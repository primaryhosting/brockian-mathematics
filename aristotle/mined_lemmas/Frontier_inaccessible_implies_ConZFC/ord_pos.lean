# The cumulative hierarchy and inaccessible cardinals

This file defines the von Neumann cumulative hierarchy `Frontier.cumul o` inside `ZFSet`,
characterizes its members by rank, and proves the two facts about an inaccessible cardinal `κ`
that are needed to see that `V_κ` is a model of ZFC:

* `Frontier.card_lt_of_rank_lt`: a set of rank `< κ.ord` has cardinality `< κ`;
* `Frontier.rank_range_lt`: `V_κ` is closed under images of small families (replacement).
