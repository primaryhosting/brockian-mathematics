# Sixth Unitary Perfect Exists

## Overview

A *unitary divisor* of `n` is a divisor `d` with `gcd d (n / d) = 1`, and `n` is *unitary
perfect* when the sum `σ*(n)` of its unitary divisors equals `2 * n`.  Exactly five unitary
perfect numbers are known:

`6`, `60`, `90`, `87360`, `146361946186458562560000`,

and whether a sixth one exists is an open problem.  This file develops the basic theory
(`σ*` is multiplicative, `σ*(p^a) = 1 + p^a`, the factorization formula), verifies the five
known examples, proves that every unitary perfect number is even, and reduces the existence
of a sixth unitary perfect number to an explicit arithmetic criterion on the odd part.
