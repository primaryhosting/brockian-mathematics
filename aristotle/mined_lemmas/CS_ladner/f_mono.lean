## Ladner's theorem

  If `P ≠ NP` then `NP`-intermediate problems exist: there is a language in `NP` which is
  neither in `P` nor `NP`-hard.

Languages are modelled as predicates on the natural numbers (natural numbers stand for the
strings over the underlying alphabet, under a fixed encoding), and `len x` is the length of
the string encoded by `x`.

The development is organised around a `CS.Setting`, which bundles the data and the standard
structural facts about polynomial-time computation used by Ladner's proof:

* `P ⊆ NP`, closure of `P` under finite variations, and the fact that `P` is *recursively
  presentable*, i.e. it comes with an enumeration `Penum` of all of its members;
* an enumeration `redFun` of the polynomial-time computable functions, such that `Red A B`
  ("`A` reduces to `B`") holds exactly when some `redFun i` is a many-one reduction of `A` to
  `B`, together with the downward closure of `P` under `Red`;
* an `NP`-complete language `SAT`;
* the *effectiveness* input of Ladner's proof: the language produced by the delayed
  diagonalisation construction below (`ladnerLang`) belongs to `NP`.  In the concrete setting
  this holds because Ladner's stage function is polynomial-time computable, so that the
  constructed language is the intersection of `SAT` with a polynomial-time decidable set of
  lengths.

What is proved here from `P ≠ NP` is the delayed diagonalisation ("looking back") argument
itself: the constructed language is not in `P`, and `SAT` does not reduce to it, so it is
`NP`-intermediate.

The file is deliberately self-contained: it uses only the Lean 4 core library.
