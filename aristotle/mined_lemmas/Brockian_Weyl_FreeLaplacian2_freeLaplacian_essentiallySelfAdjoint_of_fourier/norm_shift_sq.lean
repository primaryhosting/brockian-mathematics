The free Laplacian `-Δ`, defined on the Schwartz space `𝓢(ℝ^d, ℂ)` regarded as a dense
subspace of `L²(ℝ^d, ℂ)`, is essentially self-adjoint.

The proof follows the classical "basic criterion" of von Neumann/Weyl:

* an abstract criterion (`essentiallySelfAdjoint_of_dense_shift_ranges`): a densely defined
  symmetric operator whose deficiency ranges `Ran (T ± i)` are dense is essentially
  self-adjoint;
* the Fourier transform turns `-Δ` on Schwartz space into multiplication by
  `ξ ↦ 4π²‖ξ‖²` (`fourier_negLaplacianS`), and dividing a smooth compactly supported
  function by `4π²‖ξ‖² ± i` (which never vanishes) produces again a smooth compactly
  supported function.  Since smooth compactly supported functions are dense in `L²` and
  the Fourier transform is unitary on `L²` (Plancherel), the deficiency ranges are dense.
