## Overview

Brocard's problem asks for the solutions of `n ! + 1 = m ^ 2`.  The only known
solutions are `n = 4, 5, 7` (with `m = 5, 11, 71`), and it is conjectured that
there are no others; in *gap* form the conjecture states that the distance from
`n ! + 1` to the nearest perfect square is positive (indeed large) for all
`n ≥ 8`.  This is an open problem.

This file contains:

* `Brockian.BrocardGap.brocardGap`, the distance from `n ! + 1` to the nearest
  perfect square, and the characterisation `brocardGap_pos_iff`;
* `Brockian.BrocardGap.ABC`, the `abc` conjecture (in radical form);
* `Brockian.BrocardGap.BrocardGapConjecture`, a Lean-checked **conditional
  reduction**: the `abc` conjecture implies that the Brocard gap is positive for
  all sufficiently large `n` (this is Overholt's argument);
* `Brockian.BrocardGap.brocardGap_pos_of_mem_Icc`, an unconditional verification
  of the gap positivity for `8 ≤ n ≤ 200`;
* `Brockian.BrocardGap.brocard_iff_pronic`, the elementary reformulation of
  Brocard's equation as `n ! = 4 * a * (a + 1)`.
