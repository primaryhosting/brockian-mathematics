## Overview

This file formalises the *sharpness of the phase transition* for the Ising model in the
following Lean-checked form.

* `Frontier.Ising.SharpData` bundles the data of a two–point function `τ β n`
  (the truncated correlation at distance `n` and inverse temperature `β`) together with the
  structural inputs coming from the Ising model: it is a number in `[0,1]`, it is
  nondecreasing in `β`, and it is submultiplicative in the distance (the Simon–Lieb /
  Duminil-Copin–Tassion input).

* `Frontier.duminil_ising_sharp` is the sharpness statement: for **every** `β` the model is
  either *subcritical* (`τ β n` decays exponentially in `n`) or exhibits *long-range order*
  (`τ β n = 1` for all `n`); these two behaviours are mutually exclusive, and they are
  separated by a critical value `βc : EReal`: below `βc` one has exponential decay, above
  `βc` one has long-range order.  In particular no intermediate (e.g. polynomial) decay of
  correlations can occur — this is exactly the content of sharpness.

* The statement is not vacuous: the second half of the file constructs the genuine
  one-dimensional Ising chain (spins `Fin (N+1) → Bool`, nearest neighbour Hamiltonian,
  Gibbs weights `exp (β σᵢσⱼ)`, free boundary conditions), computes its partition function
  and its two-point function exactly (`Frontier.Ising.corr_eq_tanh_pow` :
  `⟨σ₀σ_N⟩ = tanh(β)^N`), and shows that it produces `SharpData` whose critical point is
  `βc = +∞`, i.e. the classical fact that the one-dimensional Ising model is subcritical at
  every finite temperature.
