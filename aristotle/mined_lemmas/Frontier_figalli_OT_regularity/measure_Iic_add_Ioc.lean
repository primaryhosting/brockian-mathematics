## Setting

Figalli's regularity theory for optimal transport says, roughly, that if the cost function
satisfies the Ma–Trudinger–Wang (MTW) condition, and the two measures have densities that
are bounded away from `0` and from `∞` on suitable domains, then the Brenier optimal
transport map is regular.

Here we formalize and prove in full the **base case** of that theory: dimension one with
quadratic cost.  In dimension one the MTW condition is vacuous, the Brenier map is the
*monotone rearrangement* `T = G⁻¹ ∘ F`, characterized by the matching of cumulative
distribution functions `G (T x) = F x`, and the regularity statement takes the sharp
quantitative form

  (density of `μ` `≤ Λ`) and (density of `ν` `≥ lam > 0`)  ⟹  `T` is `(Λ / lam)`-Lipschitz.

The density bounds are used only through their integrated consequences,
`μ (Ioc x y) ≤ Λ (y - x)` and `ν (Ioc x y) ≥ lam (y - x)`, so these are taken as the
hypotheses.  As in the classical theory, the lower bound on the target density is imposed
only on the (bounded) target domain `B`, and the estimate is obtained on the source
domain `A`; a global lower bound would be incompatible with finiteness of `ν`.
