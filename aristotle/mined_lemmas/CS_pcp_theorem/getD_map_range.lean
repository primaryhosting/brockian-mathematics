## Overview

This file formalises the statement `NP = PCP(log n, O(1))` (the PCP theorem) in the
non-uniform (Boolean circuit) model of efficient computation, and proves the "easy"
inclusion `PCP(log n, O(1)) ⊆ NP` in full.

*  A language is a predicate on bit strings (`CS.Language`).
*  `CS.InNP L` says that `L` has a polynomial-length witness that is checked by a
   polynomial-size Boolean circuit.
*  `CS.InPCP L` says that `L` has a probabilistically checkable proof system with
   `O(log n)` random bits, a constant number `q` of queries, perfect completeness and
   soundness error at most `1/2`; the query positions and the decision predicate are
   computed by polynomial-size circuits.

`CS.pcp_subset_np` proves `PCP(log n, O(1)) ⊆ NP` unconditionally: a witness for the NP
system is the table of answers of the PCP verifier on all `2^{O(log n)} = poly(n)` random
strings, together with the consistency requirement that two queries landing on the same
proof position receive the same answer.

Proof positions are named by bit strings of length `pbits n` with `pbits` polynomially
bounded; since the verifier only ever inspects `2 ^ rlen n * q = poly(n)` positions, no
further restriction on the proof length is needed.

The reverse inclusion `NP ⊆ PCP(log n, O(1))` is the deep content of the PCP theorem
(Arora–Safra, Arora–Lund–Motwani–Sudan–Szegedy); it is *not* proved here, and appears as
an explicit hypothesis `hard` of `CS.pcp_theorem`.
