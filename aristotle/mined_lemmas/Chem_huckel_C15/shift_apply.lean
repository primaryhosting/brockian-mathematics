# Hückel spectrum of the cycle graph `C₁₅`

The eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of the cycle graph `C₁₅` (the Hückel spectrum of a
15-membered annulene, in units of β above α) are exactly the numbers `2 cos (2πk/15)`
for `k = 0, …, 14`.

The proof writes the adjacency matrix as `S + S¹⁴`, where `S` is the cyclic shift permutation
matrix, identifies the spectrum of `S` with the set of 15-th roots of unity, and then applies
the polynomial spectral mapping theorem over `ℂ`.
