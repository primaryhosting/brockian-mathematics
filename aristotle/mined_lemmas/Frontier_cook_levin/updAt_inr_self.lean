This development is self-contained (no imports): it builds, from scratch,

* propositional formulas in conjunctive normal form (CNF) and satisfiability,
* Boolean circuits (as formulas over a fixed set of input variables),
* the Tseitin transformation from circuits to CNF, with its correctness proof
  and a linear size bound,
* the notion of an `NP` verifier (a polynomial-size circuit family together
  with a polynomially bounded witness length),

and proves the Cook–Levin theorem in the following form.

`Frontier.cook_levin`: every language `L` admitting a polynomial-size circuit
verifier reduces to `SAT` by an (explicitly constructed, hence computable)
map `f` such that `x ∈ L ↔ f x` is satisfiable, and the size of `f x` is
bounded by a polynomial in the length of `x`.

`Frontier.sat_in_np`: conversely, `SAT` itself lies in `NP`: a CNF `c` is
satisfiable iff there is a witness (a Boolean word of length the number of
variables of `c`) accepted by a circuit of size linear in `c`, which is
constructed from `c` by the explicit map `cnfCircuit`.

## Scope

Membership in `NP` is formalised here through *verifier circuits* rather than
through Turing machines: a language is in `NP` when there are a circuit family
`V` of polynomially bounded size and a witness-length function `m` such that
`V n` accepts exactly the pairs (input of length `n`, witness of length `m n`)
that certify membership. The step which is proved is therefore the
circuit-satisfiability core of Cook–Levin (the Tseitin translation of an
arbitrary verifier circuit into an equisatisfiable CNF of linear size, together
with the hard-wiring of the input), and not the simulation of a
polynomial-time Turing machine by a polynomial-size circuit family. All
constructions here are explicit computable functions, and the size bounds are
proved, not assumed.
