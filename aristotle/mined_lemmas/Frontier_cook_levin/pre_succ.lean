# The class NP, via polynomial-size verifier circuits

A language `L ⊆ {0,1}*` is in `NP` when there is a family of Boolean circuits
`circ n`, of size polynomial in `n`, such that `x ∈ L` iff some setting of the
"free" inputs (the inputs of index `≥ |x|`, i.e. the witness) makes `circ |x|`
accept the string `x`.

Note that no bound on the witness has to be imposed: a circuit of size `s` reads
at most `s` of its inputs, so the witness is automatically of polynomial length.

# Basic objects: CNF formulas and Boolean circuits

This file sets up the two computational objects used in the Cook–Levin development:

* CNF formulas over natural-number variables, and their satisfiability;
* Boolean circuits, presented as straight-line programs with *relative*
  back-references (a gate at position `i` may refer to the gate `d` steps
  before it).  Out-of-range references evaluate to `false`, so evaluation is
  total and no well-formedness side condition is ever needed.
* Boolean *expressions* (trees) together with a compiler into circuits.  This
  is only used as a convenient way of building concrete circuits.
