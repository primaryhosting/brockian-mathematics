## The Cook–Levin theorem

`Frontier.cook_levin` states that SAT is `NP`-hard: every language `L` in `NP` is reduced to
`SATLang`, the set of satisfiable CNF formulas over `ℕ`, by the explicit computable map
`Frontier.reduction`, whose output is of polynomial size.

The complexity class `NP` is modelled by single-tape nondeterministic Turing machines
(`Frontier.NTM`) with a polynomial time bound (`Frontier.InNP`), and the reduction is the
classical *tableau* construction: `Frontier.tableau M x T` is a CNF formula whose satisfying
assignments are exactly the accepting computations of `M` on `x` of length `T`
(`Frontier.tableau_satisfiable_iff`).

### Sources and scope

* Mathlib (at the version pinned by this project) contains no complexity theory: there is no
  definition of `P`, `NP`, of polynomial-time reductions, or of SAT, and no Cook–Levin
  statement.  Everything below is therefore developed from scratch, except for the CNF
  datatype `Std.Sat.CNF` and its relabelling API, which come from the Lean core library.
* What is proved is the hard half of the Cook–Levin theorem, `NP`-hardness of SAT, for
  many-one reductions that are computable Lean functions of polynomially bounded output
  size.  Two ingredients of the textbook statement are *not* formalised here: that the
  reduction runs in polynomial *time* (this project fixes no cost model for computing the
  reduction itself), and the easy half `SAT ∈ NP` (which would require programming and
  verifying a nondeterministic Turing machine that parses and evaluates encoded formulas).
  `Frontier.satisfiable_iff_exists_certificate` records the certificate characterisation of
  satisfiability that underlies the easy half.
