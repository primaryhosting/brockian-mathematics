# Hückel theory for the 5-cycle `C₅`

The Hückel secular problem for the cyclic polyene `C₅H₅` reduces (after removing the
Coulomb integral `α` and dividing by the resonance integral `β`) to the eigenvalue
problem for the adjacency matrix of the cycle graph `C₅`.

The main result `Chem.huckel_C5` states that the eigenvalues of that adjacency matrix
are exactly the five numbers `2 * cos (2 * π * k / 5)`, `k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4`
(equivalently `2`, `(√5 - 1)/2` twice and `-(√5 + 1)/2` twice).
