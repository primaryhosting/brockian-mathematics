# Existence of an Aronszajn tree

An *Aronszajn tree* is a tree of height `ω₁` all of whose levels are countable and which has
no uncountable branch (equivalently, no uncountable chain).

We formalize a tree as a partial order `T` together with a rank function `rk : T → Ordinal`
whose fibres are the levels; see `Frontier.IsAronszajnTree`.  The main result is
`Frontier.Aronszajn_tree_exists`.

/-- `rk` exhibits the partial order `T` as an Aronszajn tree:

* every node has rank a countable ordinal, and the rank strictly increases along the order;
* the set of predecessors of a node is a chain, and contains exactly one element of each
  rank below the rank of the node (so `T` is a tree and `rk` is the height function);
* every level `α < ω₁` is nonempty (the tree has height exactly `ω₁`) and countable;
* every chain (in particular every branch) of `T` is countable.
