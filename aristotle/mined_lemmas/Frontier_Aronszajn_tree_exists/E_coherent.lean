# Existence of an Aronszajn tree

An *Aronszajn tree* is a tree of height `ω₁` all of whose levels are countable and which has no
uncountable chain (equivalently, no uncountable branch).

We construct one in the classical way, from a *coherent sequence* of finite-to-one functions
`E α : α → ℕ` (`α < ω₁`), built by transfinite recursion: `E α` is finite-to-one on `α`, and for
`β < α` the functions `E α ↾ β` and `E β` differ at only finitely many places.  The tree consists
of all pairs `(α, f)` with `α < ω₁` and `f : α → ℕ` differing from `E α` at only finitely many
places, ordered by end-extension.
