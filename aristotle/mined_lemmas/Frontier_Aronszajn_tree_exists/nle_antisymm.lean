# Construction of an Aronszajn tree

We build the classical (special) Aronszajn tree: nodes at level `α < ω₁` are strictly
increasing bounded functions `α → ℚ`, constructed by transfinite recursion so that each
level is countable and every node can be extended to any higher level while keeping a
prescribed rational bound.
