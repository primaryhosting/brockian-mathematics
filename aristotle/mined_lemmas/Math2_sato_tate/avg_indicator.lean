## Contents

We formalise the Sato–Tate distribution of Frobenius angles of an elliptic curve over `ℚ`,
given by an integral Weierstrass model `W`.

* `Math2.frobAngle W p` is the Frobenius angle `θ_p ∈ [0, π]` at a prime `p`, defined by
  `a_p = 2 √p cos θ_p` where `a_p = p + 1 - #E(𝔽_p)` is the trace of Frobenius.
* `Math2.satoTateDensity` is the Sato–Tate density `(2/π) sin²θ` and `Math2.satoTateMeasure`
  is the associated probability measure on `[0, π]`.
* `Math2.SatoTateWeyl W` is the Weyl-criterion form of the Sato–Tate law: the averages over
  primes of good reduction of `U n (cos θ_p)` tend to `0` for every `n ≥ 1`, where `U n` is
  the `n`-th Chebyshev polynomial of the second kind (the character of the `n`-th symmetric
  power of the standard representation of `SU(2)`).  This is exactly the statement supplied
  by the potential automorphy theorems for a non-CM elliptic curve over `ℚ`.
* `Math2.sato_tate` deduces from it the distributional form of the Sato–Tate law: the
  proportion of primes `p ≤ N` of good reduction whose Frobenius angle lies in `[a, b]`
  converges to `(2/π) ∫_a^b sin²t dt`.
