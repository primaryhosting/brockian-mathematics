/-! ## Setting

We work with the homogeneous space `X = G / Γ` where `G = ℝ²` is an abelian Lie group and
`Γ = ℤ²` is a lattice in it, so that `X` is the two–dimensional torus `𝕋² = ℝ²/ℤ²`.
Since `G` is abelian, every one–parameter subgroup `t ↦ t • v` of `G` is unipotent
(the adjoint representation is trivial), so the flow it induces on `X` is a unipotent flow.

This is the classical abelian model case of Ratner's theorems, containing the linear flows on
the torus with irrational slope. -/
