## Setting

Cardy's formula, as proved by Smirnov for critical site percolation on the triangular
lattice, says the following.  Take a Jordan domain `Ω` with four marked boundary points
`a, b, c, d` in cyclic order, and let `Π(Ω; a, b, c, d)` be the scaling limit of the
probability that the arc `ab` is joined to the arc `cd` by an open cluster.  Then `Π`
depends only on the conformal class of the configuration `(Ω; a, b, c, d)`; concretely,
after uniformizing `Ω` onto the upper half plane `ℍ` (so that the marked points sit on
the real line), `Π` is a fixed function `F` of the *cross-ratio* of the four marked
points.

The two ingredients are therefore:

* **Cardy's formula** (`cardy` below): in the half-plane normalization the crossing
  probability is a function of the cross ratio alone;
* **conformal invariance**: the conformal automorphisms of `ℍ` are the real Möbius maps
  with positive determinant, and the crossing probability is unchanged by them.

What is formalized here is the *reduction* of conformal invariance to Cardy's formula:
granted that the limiting crossing probability has the Cardy form, it is invariant under
every Möbius change of coordinates of the half-plane (`Frontier.smirnov_percolation`), and
it automatically satisfies the self-duality relation
`Π(a,b,c,d) + Π(a,c,b,d) = 1` (`Frontier.crossing_duality`).  The analytic heart of the
reduction is the Möbius invariance of the cross ratio, proved below from scratch.

the real line, thought of as marked boundary points of the upper half plane. -/

/-- **Self-duality of crossing probabilities.**  If `Π` has Cardy's form with a function `F`
satisfying `F x + F (1 - x) = 1` (the duality of the Cardy function, reflecting that either
the primal arcs `ab`, `cd` are joined, or the dual arcs `ac`, `bd` are), then
`Π(a,b,c,d) + Π(a,c,b,d) = 1` for every nondegenerate configuration. -/
