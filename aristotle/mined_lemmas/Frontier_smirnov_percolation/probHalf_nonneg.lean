/-! ## Part 1: the discrete model (critical site percolation, `p = 1/2`)

Site percolation on a finite site set `V` (a finite piece of the triangular lattice) is
modelled as a uniformly random colouring `ω : V → Bool`, with `true` meaning *open*.  On
the triangular lattice the critical parameter is `p_c = 1/2`, so the uniform measure on
colourings is exactly the critical percolation measure. -/
