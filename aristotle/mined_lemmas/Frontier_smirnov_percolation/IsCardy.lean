## Setting

Cardy's formula, as proved by Smirnov for critical site percolation on the triangular
lattice, says the following.  Take a Jordan domain `Ω` with four marked boundary points
`a, b, c, d` in cyclic order, and let `Π(Ω; a, b, c, d)` be the scaling limit of the
probability that the arc `ab` is joined to the arc `cd` by an open cluster.  Then `Π`
depends only on the conformal class of the configuration `(Ω; a, b, c, d)`; concretely,
after uniformizing `Ω` onto the upper half plane `ℍ` (so that the marked points sit on
the real line), `Π` is a fixed function `F` of the *cross-ratio* of the four marked
points.

The two ingredients are therefore:

* **Cardy's formula** (`cardy` below): in the half-plane normalization the crossing
  probability is a function of the cross ratio alone;
* **conformal invariance**: the conformal automorphisms of `ℍ` are the real Möbius maps
  with positive determinant, and the crossing probability is unchanged by them.

What is formalized here is the *reduction* of conformal invariance to Cardy's formula:
granted that the limiting crossing probability has the Cardy form, it is invariant under
every Möbius change of coordinates of the half-plane (`Frontier.smirnov_percolation`), and
it automatically satisfies the self-duality relation
`Π(a,b,c,d) + Π(a,c,b,d) = 1` (`Frontier.crossing_duality`).  The analytic heart of the
reduction is the Möbius invariance of the cross ratio, proved below from scratch.

/-- The cross ratio `(a, b ; c, d) = ((a - c)(b - d)) / ((a - d)(b - c))` of four points of
the real line, thought of as marked boundary points of the upper half plane. -/

def IsCardy (crossingProb : ℝ → ℝ → ℝ → ℝ → ℝ) : Prop :=
  ∃ F : ℝ → ℝ, ∀ a b c d : ℝ, crossingProb a b c d = F (crossRatio a b c d)

/-- **Cardy–Smirnov conformal invariance (reduction).**

If the limiting crossing probability `Π` of critical triangular-lattice percolation has
Cardy's form in the half-plane normalization (i.e. it is a function of the cross ratio of
the four marked boundary points — Smirnov's theorem), then it is *conformally invariant*:
applying any Möbius change of coordinates `z ↦ (p z + q) / (r z + s)` with nonzero
determinant (in particular, any conformal automorphism of the upper half plane, for which
`p s - q r > 0`) to the four marked boundary points leaves the crossing probability
unchanged. -/
