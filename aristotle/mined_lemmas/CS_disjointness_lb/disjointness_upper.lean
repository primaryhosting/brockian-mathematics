## Overview

We formalise lower bounds on the communication complexity of set disjointness
`DISJ_n` on `n`-element ground sets.

* `CS.disjointness_lb` : the main target.  Any *public-coin randomised one-way*
  protocol that computes `DISJ_n` with error probability at most `1/8` on every
  input must communicate `c` bits with `n ≤ 6 * (c + 1)`, i.e. `c = Ω(n)`.
* `CS.disjointness_lb_deterministic` : any *deterministic two-way* protocol
  computing `DISJ_n` has depth (communication cost) at least `n`.
* `CS.disjointness_lb_two_way` : any randomised two-way protocol whose error
  probability on each input is smaller than `4 ^ (-n)` has depth at least `n`.
* `CS.disjointness_upper` : the hypotheses are not vacuous — a one-way protocol
  with `n` bits of communication and zero error always exists.

The proof of the main theorem is the standard argument: averaging over the public
randomness fixes a deterministic one-way protocol that is correct on average over
the hard distribution (`x` uniform, `y` a uniformly random singleton `{i}`); the
protocol's message determines a decoding `z` of Alice's input, so most inputs `x`
lie in a Hamming ball of radius `n / 4` around one of the `2 ^ c` decodings, and a
volume bound for Hamming balls forces `2 ^ c` to be exponentially large in `n`.
Note that `DISJ (x, {i}) = ¬ x i`, i.e. the index function reduces to disjointness.
