## Overview

The no-deleting theorem states that, given two copies of an unknown quantum state,
there is no unitary evolution that deletes one of the copies (sending it to a fixed
"blank" state) while leaving the ancilla in a fixed final state.

We model a qubit by `EuclideanSpace ℂ (Fin 2)`, an ancilla by `EuclideanSpace ℂ α`
for an arbitrary finite index type `α`, and the tensor product of state vectors by
`QI.tens` (the Kronecker product of coordinate vectors, which is the standard
concrete model of the tensor product of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces).

A unitary is modelled as a `ℂ`-linear isometric equivalence `U`.  The key facts used
are that `U` preserves inner products and that the inner product is multiplicative
with respect to `tens`.
