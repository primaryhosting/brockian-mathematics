## Suslin's problem, stated precisely

A *linear continuum* is a nonempty densely ordered linear order without endpoints in which every
nonempty bounded-above set has a least upper bound (i.e. `ℝ`-like order completeness).

The *countable chain condition* (ccc) says: every family of pairwise disjoint nonempty open sets is
countable.

A **Suslin line** is a linear continuum, equipped with its order topology, which satisfies the ccc
but is *not* separable.  Cantor's theorem characterises `ℝ` as the unique separable linear
continuum; **Suslin's problem** asks whether "separable" may be weakened to "ccc" in that
characterisation, i.e. whether a Suslin line exists.  The statement "no Suslin line exists" is
*Suslin's Hypothesis* (`Frontier.SuslinHypothesis` below).

Suslin's Hypothesis is independent of ZFC (Jech, Tennenbaum, Solovay–Tennenbaum): Jensen's diamond
principle `◊` implies that a Suslin line exists, while `MA + ¬CH` implies that none does.  Neither
implication — nor any "iff" between the existence of a Suslin line and `◊`-type hypotheses — is a
