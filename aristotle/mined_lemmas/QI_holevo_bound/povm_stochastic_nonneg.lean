# Holevo Bound
Category: Frontier Qi
Target: QI.holevo_bound
Verification: pending
Provenance: Aristotle theorem prover (Harmonic)

## Contents

* `QI.log_sum_le`, `QI.klDiv_stochastic_le`, `QI.classical_holevo`: the classical core, namely the
  log-sum inequality, the data-processing inequality for the Kullback–Leibler divergence, and the
  resulting data-processing inequality for mutual information.
* `QI.vonNeumannEntropy`, `QI.IsState`, `QI.IsPOVM`, `QI.outcomeProb`, `QI.holevoChi`,
  `QI.measuredInfo`, `QI.accessibleInfo`: the quantum-information definitions.
* `QI.holevo_bound`: for an ensemble of density matrices measured by an arbitrary POVM, the
  mutual information between the ensemble label and the measurement outcome is at most the
  Holevo quantity `χ`.
* `QI.accessibleInfo_le_holevoChi`: the same statement for the supremum over POVMs.

## Scope

The ensemble is assumed to consist of *commuting* density matrices: they are given as
`ρ x = U * diagonal (r x) * Uᴴ` for one fixed unitary `U` and probability vectors `r x`.  The
measurement, on the other hand, is a completely arbitrary POVM, so the argument is not a purely
classical one: the POVM has to be turned into a stochastic matrix via `i ↦ (Uᴴ (E y) U) i i`.
The fully general (non-commuting) Holevo bound needs monotonicity of the *quantum* relative
entropy under measurement, which is not available in Mathlib.
