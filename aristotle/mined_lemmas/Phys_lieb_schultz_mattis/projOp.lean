## Statement

A half-integer-spin translation-invariant chain is gapless or degenerate.

We formalise this for the spin-`1/2` XY chain with `L` sites and periodic boundary
conditions, whose Hilbert space is `Phys.Chain L = EuclideanSpace ℂ (Fin L → Bool)` and
whose Hamiltonian `Phys.hamOp L` is the translation invariant nearest neighbour exchange
Hamiltonian `-∑ⱼ (S⁺ⱼ S⁻ⱼ₊₁ + S⁻ⱼ S⁺ⱼ₊₁)`.

The theorem `Phys.lieb_schultz_mattis` states the LSM dichotomy in finite volume: either
the ground state is degenerate (there are two orthogonal ground states), or there is a
state orthogonal to the ground state whose energy exceeds the ground state energy by at
most `2π²/L`.  Since this bound tends to `0` as `L → ∞`
(`Phys.lieb_schultz_mattis_bound_tendsto_zero`), the chain is gapless or degenerate.

The proof is the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis twist argument: the twist operator
`U = exp (i (2π/L) ∑ⱼ j Sᶻⱼ)` produces a variational state of energy `cos (2π/L) E₀`,
and it satisfies the *anomalous* commutation relation `T U = -e^{-i(2π/L)Sᶻ} U T` with the
translation `T`.  The crucial sign `-1` is `exp (2π i Sᶻ)` for the half-integer spin `Sᶻ`
carried by the site that wraps around the chain; it forces the twisted state to be
orthogonal to any non-degenerate (hence translation invariant) ground state.

/-- **Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem** for the translation invariant spin-`1/2` (half-integer
spin) XY chain with `L ≥ 2` sites and periodic boundary conditions:

either the ground state is degenerate, or there is an excited state whose energy lies
within `2π²/L` of the ground state energy.  As `L → ∞` this bound tends to zero: the chain
is gapless or degenerate. -/
