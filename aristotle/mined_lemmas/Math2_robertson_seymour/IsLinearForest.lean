module docstring above is placed directly after `import Mathlib` (a `/-! ... -/` block
before the import is a parse error).

/-- `IsMinor H G` says that `H` is a minor of `G`: there is a family of pairwise disjoint,
nonempty, connected *branch sets* `B w ⊆ V(G)`, indexed by the vertices `w` of `H`, such
that adjacent vertices of `H` have an edge of `G` between their branch sets. -/
