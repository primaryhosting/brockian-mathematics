## Overview

A *unitary divisor* of `n` is a divisor `d` with `gcd (d, n / d) = 1`, and `n` is *unitary
perfect* if the sum `σ*(n)` of its unitary divisors equals `2 n`.  Exactly five unitary
perfect numbers are known:

`6, 60, 90, 87360, 146361946186458562560000`,

and it is a long-standing open problem whether a sixth one exists.  Accordingly this file
does **not** prove unconditional existence; it develops the basic theory of `σ*`
(multiplicativity, values at prime powers), verifies that the five known numbers really are
unitary perfect, proves that every unitary perfect number is even, and finally proves the
target statement `SixthUnitaryPerfectExists` as a *conditional reduction*: any unitary
perfect number that either exceeds the largest known one or fails to be divisible by `3`
is a sixth unitary perfect number.

imports to come first in a file.)
