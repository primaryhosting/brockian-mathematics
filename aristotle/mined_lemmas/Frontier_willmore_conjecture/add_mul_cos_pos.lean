/-! ## The torus of revolution and its Willmore energy

For `0 < r < R`, the torus of revolution `T R r ⊆ ℝ³` obtained by revolving the circle of
radius `r` centred at distance `R` from the axis is parametrised by

  `(θ, φ) ↦ ((R + r cos θ) cos φ, (R + r cos θ) sin φ, r sin θ)`,  `θ, φ ∈ [0, 2π]`.

Its two principal curvatures are `1 / r` (along the meridian circle) and
`cos θ / (R + r cos θ)` (along the parallel circle), and its area element is
`r (R + r cos θ) dθ dφ`.  These classical formulas are taken as the definitions below;
the Willmore energy `∫ H² dA` is then the honest double integral of the square of the mean
curvature against the area element.
