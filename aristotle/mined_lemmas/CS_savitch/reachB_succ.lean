/-! ## Machine model

We work with a *non-uniform* space-bounded machine model.  A machine works on inputs of one
fixed length; a language belongs to a space class if for every input length there is a machine
of the appropriate size deciding the language on inputs of that length.

A machine is described by its set of configurations `Cfg` (which is the whole memory of the
machine: the space used is `log₂ (card Cfg)`), a designated start configuration, a function
`head` telling which position of the (read-only) input is currently scanned, and a transition
which may depend on the current configuration and on the single input bit that is being read.
Note that the machine has *no* other access to the input, which is what makes the space measure
meaningful. -/
