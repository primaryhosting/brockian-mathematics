The machine model is the standard off-line random-access model of space bounded computation
(see `RequestProject/Savitch/Model.lean`): the memory of a machine is a bit string, one step
rewrites the memory using the memory content and a single input bit, read at a position which
is determined by the memory, and the space used on an input is the maximal length of a memory
string occurring in the computation.

`NSPACE f` and `DSPACE g` are the classes of languages accepted by nondeterministic,
respectively deterministic, machines running in space `O (f n)`, respectively `O (g n)`.

The proof is Savitch's: for a nondeterministic machine `M` running in space `S` on the input
`x`, deciding whether `M` accepts amounts to deciding reachability in the configuration graph
of `M` on `x`, whose vertices are the words of length at most `S`.  Reachability by a path of
length at most `2 ^ k` is decided by the midpoint recursion `savR`, whose recursion depth is
`k`; taking `k = S + 1` suffices because there are only `2 ^ (S + 1) - 1` configurations.  The
simulator runs this recursion with an explicit stack of at most `S + 2` frames, each holding
three words of length at most `S`, so it uses `O (S ^ 2)` bits.  Since the simulator does not
know `S`, it runs the whole procedure for stages `s = 0, 1, 2, …`, and at each stage also
checks whether some reachable configuration has a successor of length more than `s`; the first
stage at which this check fails gives the correct answer, and this happens at the latest at
stage `S`.
