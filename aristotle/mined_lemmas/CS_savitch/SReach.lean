The space-bounded machine model, the classes `CS.NSPACE`, `CS.DSPACE`,
`CS.PSPACE` and `CS.NPSPACE`, and the simulator used in the proof are defined in
the files `RequestProject/Savitch/*.lean`.

A machine reads its input through a head whose position is determined by its
memory value, and it works in space `g` if on inputs of length `n` all reachable
memory values lie in a set of at most `2 ^ g n` values depending only on `n`
(the standard correspondence between `s` tape cells and `2 ^ O(s)`
configurations).  The classes `NSPACE g` and `DSPACE g` are closed under
constant factors by definition, as usual for space classes.

Savitch's theorem is proved for space bounds `f` with `n + 1 ≤ 2 ^ f n`
(i.e. `f n ≥ log₂ (n+1)`), the standard hypothesis `f (n) ≥ log n`.

/-- **Savitch's theorem**: a language recognized by a nondeterministic machine in
space `f` (with `f n ≥ log₂ (n + 1)`) is recognized by a deterministic machine in
space `O(f²)`, i.e. `NSPACE f ⊆ DSPACE (f²)`. -/
