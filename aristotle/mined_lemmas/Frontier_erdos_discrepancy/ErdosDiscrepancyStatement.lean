This file is deliberately self-contained (no imports): a Lean module docstring
must be the first command in a file, so the required header above forces the
file to contain no `import` lines.  Everything below therefore uses only the
Lean 4 core library.  The file `RequestProject/Main.lean` re-states the results
in Mathlib terms (`∑ i ∈ Finset.Icc 1 n, f (i * d)` and `|·|`) and proves that
the two formulations agree.

/-- The partial sum of `f` along the homogeneous arithmetic progression with
common difference `d`, over its first `n` terms:  `f d + f (2d) + ⋯ + f (n d)`. -/
