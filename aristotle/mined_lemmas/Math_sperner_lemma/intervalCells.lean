## Combinatorial setting

A triangulation of an `m`-dimensional simplex whose vertices (of the big simplex) are
labelled by a finite set `I` of labels (`I.card = m + 1`) is described combinatorially by:

* a type `V` of vertices of the triangulation;
* a *carrier* map `car : V → Finset ι`, sending a vertex `v` to the set of labels spanning
  the smallest face of the big simplex containing `v` (the support of the barycentric
  coordinates of `v`);
* a finite family `cells : Finset (Finset V)` of maximal cells, each with `m + 1` vertices.

The defining combinatorial properties of a triangulation (a "pseudomanifold with boundary"
whose boundary is the triangulated boundary of the simplex) are:

* every `m`-element face (*facet*) of a cell lies in exactly two cells if it is interior,
  and in exactly one cell if it lies in a proper face of the big simplex (equivalently,
  the union of the carriers of its vertices is not all of `I`);
* for every label `i`, the facets lying in the face opposite to `i` form, with the same
  carrier map, a triangulation of that `(m-1)`-dimensional face.

This is `Math.IsTriang` below.  A *Sperner colouring* is a map `c : V → ι` with
`c v ∈ car v` for every vertex `v`, and a cell is *rainbow* when the colours of its
vertices are exactly the labels `I`.
