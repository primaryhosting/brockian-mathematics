# Gale–Stewart for topologically open payoff sets

`Frontier.Gale_Stewart_open` states openness of the payoff set combinatorially (membership of a
play is guaranteed by a finite initial segment of it).  Here we record the corollary phrased with
Mathlib's product topology on `ℕ → A`.

/-- **Gale–Stewart theorem**, topological form: if the payoff set `W` is open in the product
topology on `ℕ → A` (for instance, the product of discrete topologies), then the associated
infinite game is determined. -/
