Every open game is determined (Gale–Stewart).

We consider the infinite two-player game on a nonempty set `A` of moves: the two players
alternately choose elements of `A`, player I moving at the even stages and player II at the odd
stages, producing a play `x : ℕ → A`.  Player I wins the play `x` iff `x ∈ W`, where `W` is the
payoff set.  A *strategy* is a function `List A → A` assigning a move to every position (finite
sequence of previous moves).

The theorem states: if `W` is open in the product topology on `ℕ → A` (with `A` discrete), then
either player I has a winning strategy or player II has one.
