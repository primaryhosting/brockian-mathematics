# Gale–Stewart for open games: the topological form

`RequestProject.Frontier` proves the Gale–Stewart theorem `Frontier.Gale_Stewart_open` with the
combinatorial formulation of openness (`Frontier.IsOpenPayoff`).  Here we check that this
hypothesis is exactly openness of the payoff set in the product topology on `ℕ → A` where `A`
carries the discrete topology, and record the resulting topological statement
`Frontier.Gale_Stewart_open_topological`.

(Discreteness of `A` is only needed for the converse implication
`Frontier.isOpen_of_isOpenPayoff`; openness for an arbitrary topology on `A` already implies the
combinatorial condition, hence determinacy.)
