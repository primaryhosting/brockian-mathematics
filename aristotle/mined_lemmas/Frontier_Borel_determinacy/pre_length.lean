/-! ## The game framework

We consider infinite two–player games on a set `A` of moves.  A *play* is a sequence
`x : ℕ → A`; player `0` chooses the moves `x n` with `n` even, player `1` chooses the moves
`x n` with `n` odd.  A *strategy* is a function `List A → A` assigning a move to every finite
position (the player only consults it at their own turns). -/
