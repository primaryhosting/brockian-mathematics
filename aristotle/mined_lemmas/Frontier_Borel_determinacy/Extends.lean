## Overview

We formalise infinite two-player perfect-information games on Baire space `ℕ → ℕ`
(the standard setting for Borel determinacy), together with strategies, winning
strategies and determinacy.

* `Frontier.BorelDeterminacy` is the full statement of Martin's theorem: every game whose
  payoff set is Borel is determined.
* `Frontier.Borel_determinacy` is the *base case* of that statement, proved here in full:
  every game whose payoff set lies at the bottom level of the Borel hierarchy
  (`Σ⁰₁`, i.e. open, or `Π⁰₁`, i.e. closed) is determined.  This is the Gale–Stewart
  theorem, the base case on which Martin's inductive unravelling argument rests.
  Mathlib contains no determinacy results, so the game-theoretic framework and the
  proof are developed here from scratch.

The proof of the base case is the classical one: if the first player has no winning
strategy from the empty position, the second player can move so as to preserve the
property "the first player has no winning strategy from the current position", and an
open payoff set would be entered only at a position from which the first player wins
trivially.
