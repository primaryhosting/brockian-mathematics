/-! ## Infinite games: positions, strategies, winning strategies

We consider infinite two-player games with perfect information played on an alphabet `X`.
A *play* is a sequence `x : ℕ → X`; the move at time `n` is `x n`.  Which player moves at
time `n` is recorded by a predicate `turn : ℕ → Prop` (the *turn set* of the player under
consideration).  In the classical game `G(A)` on Baire space, player I moves at the even
times and player II at the odd times, and player I wins the play `x` iff `x ∈ A`.
