# Trace-norm bounds for cosine Gram matrices (the `CosTraceNorm` family)

For a real symmetric matrix `A` we define its *trace norm* (nuclear norm, Schatten
`1`-norm) as the sum of the absolute values of its eigenvalues.

The main objects of study are the *cosine Gram matrices*
`cosMatrix f θ = (cos (f * (θ i - θ j)))_{i,j}` and their linear combinations
`cosCombo c f θ = ∑ k, c k • cosMatrix (f k) θ`.

The main result `Brockian.CosTraceNorm1279` gives two-sided trace-norm bounds for
`cosCombo c f θ` with arbitrary (possibly signed) coefficients `c`.
