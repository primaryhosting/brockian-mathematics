## The model

An *isolation engine* mediates between untrusted requests and a capability-guarded
runtime.  It carries a partial recognizer (a handler table), a capability demand for
each action it can emit, and the set of capabilities the ambient sandbox actually
grants.  The engine's totality discipline is *bail on unrecognized*: any request the
recognizer does not classify produces the inert `bail` outcome rather than a guess.

Capability sets are modelled as predicates `Cap → Prop`, with `Demands ⊆ Granted`
spelled out pointwise, so the development is self-contained.
