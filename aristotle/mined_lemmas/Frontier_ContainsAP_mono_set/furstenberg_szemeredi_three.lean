Note on the header: Lean 4 requires `import` commands to be the very first commands of a
file, so the module docstring above is placed immediately after `import Mathlib`.

## Contents

* `Frontier.ContainsAP A k` : the set `A ⊆ ℕ` contains an arithmetic progression of length `k`
  with positive common difference.
* `Frontier.upperDensity A` : the upper asymptotic density of `A ⊆ ℕ`.
* `Frontier.FinitarySzemeredi k` : the finitary form of Szemerédi's theorem for progressions of
  length `k`.
* `Frontier.furstenberg_szemeredi` : the reduction of Szemerédi's theorem (positive upper density
  sets of naturals contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions) to its finitary form.
* `Frontier.finitarySzemeredi_three` : the finitary statement for `k = 3`, deduced from Roth's
  theorem (available in Mathlib as `roth_3ap_theorem_nat`).
* `Frontier.furstenberg_szemeredi_three` : the resulting *unconditional* base case: every set of
  naturals of positive upper density contains a 3-term arithmetic progression.
