## Setup: the dihedral group acting on the vertices of a regular `n`-gon

We model the vertices of the regular `n`-gon by `ZMod n`.  The dihedral group
`DihedralGroup n` acts on them, with the rotation `r i` translating by `-i` and the
reflection `sr i` acting by `x ↦ i - x`.  (The signs are dictated by Mathlib's
multiplication convention `r i * r j = r (i + j)`, `r i * sr j = sr (j - i)`,
`sr i * r j = sr (i + j)`, `sr i * sr j = r (j - i)`.)
