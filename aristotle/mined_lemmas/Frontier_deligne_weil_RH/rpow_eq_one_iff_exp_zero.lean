## Formalization of the Riemann hypothesis for varieties over finite fields

We package the cohomological data attached to a smooth projective variety `X` of
dimension `d` over the finite field `𝔽_q` (as produced by ℓ-adic étale cohomology):

* `eigen i` is the multiset of eigenvalues of the geometric Frobenius acting on the
  `i`-th cohomology group (so `(eigen i).card` is the `i`-th Betti number);
* `count m` is `#X(𝔽_{q^m})`;
* `trace_formula` is the Grothendieck–Lefschetz trace formula;
* `weight` is *Deligne's theorem* (the Riemann hypothesis, Weil conjecture III):
  every Frobenius eigenvalue on `H^i` has archimedean absolute value `q^{i/2}`.

The zeta function of `X` is `Z(X, T) = ∏_i P_i(T)^{(-1)^{i+1}}` with
`P_i(T) = ∏_{α ∈ eigen i} (1 - α T)`, and `ζ(X, s) = Z(X, q^{-s})`.
The classical phrasing of the Riemann hypothesis is that the zeros
(resp. poles) of `ζ(X, s)` lie on the vertical lines `Re s = i/2` for `i` odd
(resp. even).  The main theorem below, `Frontier.deligne_weil_RH`, is exactly this
statement: it is a Lean-checked reduction of the "critical line" form of the
Riemann hypothesis to the "absolute value of Frobenius eigenvalues" form.

We also verify the base case: projective space `ℙ^n` over `𝔽_q` carries such a
package (`Frontier.WeilPackage.projectiveSpace`), with the correct point counts
`#ℙ^n(𝔽_{q^m}) = 1 + q^m + ⋯ + q^{nm}`, so the theorem applies to it
unconditionally.

/-- **The Riemann hypothesis for varieties over finite fields** (Weil conjectures,
proved by Deligne), in its "critical line" form.

If `X` is a smooth projective variety of dimension `d` over `𝔽_q` whose
cohomological data is packaged as a `WeilPackage` (Grothendieck–Lefschetz trace
formula together with Deligne's purity theorem), then every zero of the `i`-th
factor `P_i(q^{-s})` of the zeta function `ζ(X, s)` lies on the vertical line
`Re s = i / 2`.

In particular the zeros of `ζ(X, s)` (coming from the odd-degree factors) lie on
the lines `Re s = 1/2, 3/2, …, (2d-1)/2` and its poles (coming from the
even-degree factors) lie on the lines `Re s = 0, 1, …, d`. -/
