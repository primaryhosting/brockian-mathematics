# Oscillator Spectrum

(Lean requires `import` commands to precede every other command, including module
documentation, so the header comment above is a plain block comment.)

We realise the one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator algebraically on the Fock space
`ℕ →₀ ℂ`, whose basis vector `Finsupp.single n 1` is the number state `|n⟩`.  The ladder
operators `a` (`QPhys.ann`) and `a†` (`QPhys.cre`) satisfy the canonical commutation
relation `[a, a†] = 1`, the number operator `N = a† a` acts diagonally, and the Hamiltonian
`H = ℏω (a†a + ½)` has eigenvalues exactly `ℏω(n + ½)`, `n ∈ ℕ`.

/-- The annihilation (lowering) operator, `a |n⟩ = √n |n-1⟩`.  For `n = 0` the prefactor
`√0 = 0` vanishes, so `|0⟩` is the vacuum. -/

/-- The `n`-th excited state is produced from the vacuum by the raising operator:
`(a†)^n |0⟩ = √(n!) |n⟩`. -/
