Mathlib (as of the pinned revision) contains no singular cohomology of complex
varieties, no Hodge decomposition and no Chow groups / cycle class maps, so there
is no existing lemma that closes this goal: the statement has to be built from
scratch.  We therefore

* define rational Hodge structures (`Frontier.HodgeStructure`) and their spaces of
  Hodge classes (`Frontier.hodgeClasses`),
* package the cohomological data of a smooth projective complex variety together
  with its cycle class maps (`Frontier.HodgeData`),
* state the Hodge conjecture for such data (`Frontier.HodgeConjecture`), and
* prove, in `Frontier.hodge_statement`, the base case `p = 0` of the conjecture
  together with the standard reduction of the conjecture to the inclusion
  "every Hodge class is algebraic".
