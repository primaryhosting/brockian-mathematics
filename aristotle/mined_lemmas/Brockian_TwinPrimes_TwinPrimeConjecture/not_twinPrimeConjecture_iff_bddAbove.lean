# Twin Prime Conjecture
Category: Brockian Conjecture
Target: Brockian.TwinPrimes.TwinPrimeConjecture
Verification: pending
Provenance: Aristotle theorem prover (Harmonic)

The Twin Prime Conjecture is a famous open problem; it is stated below as
`Brockian.TwinPrimes.TwinPrimeConjecture`.  What this file establishes, fully and
axiom-cleanly, is a set of Lean-checked *reductions* and *partial results*:

* `twinPrimeConjecture_iff_infinite` : the conjecture is equivalent to the infinitude of
  the set of twin primes;
* `clement` : **Clement's criterion** — for `n ≥ 2`, `n` and `n + 2` are both prime iff
  `n * (n + 2) ∣ 4 * ((n - 1)! + 1) + n`;
* `twinPrimeConjecture_iff_clement` : consequently the conjecture is equivalent to a purely
  arithmetic statement about factorial congruences;
* `not_twinPrimeConjecture_iff_bddAbove` : its negation is equivalent to the existence of a
  largest twin prime pair;
* unconditional partial results: `six_dvd_succ_of_twin` and `twin_primes_small`.
