# Twisted spheres

A *twisted sphere* is obtained by gluing two copies of the closed `n`-disk along their boundary
`𝕊ⁿ⁻¹` by a homeomorphism `f`.  All the known exotic spheres in dimension `7` arise this way
(Milnor's `S³`-bundles over `S⁴` carry Morse functions with exactly two critical points, which exhibits
them as twisted spheres).

The main result of this file is that **every twisted sphere is homeomorphic to the standard
sphere**: this is the topological half of Milnor's theorem, and it is proved here in full, for
every dimension `n`, using the Alexander trick from `RequestProject.AlexanderTrick`.
