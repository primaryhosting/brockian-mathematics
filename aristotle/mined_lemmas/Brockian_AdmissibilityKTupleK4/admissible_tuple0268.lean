# Admissibility of 4-tuples, `ZMod` formulation

Companion to `RequestProject.Main`.  The main file is developed without `import`s (its header
comment must be the very first thing in the file, which rules out importing Mathlib), so the
notions used there — primality and "the tuple avoids a residue class mod `p`" — are spelled out
from first principles.  Here we check, using Mathlib, that those notions agree with the
standard ones (`Nat.Prime` and non-surjectivity into `ZMod p`), and restate the main theorem
`Brockian.AdmissibilityKTupleK4` in that language.
