## Overview

We develop the general theory of equidecomposability and paradoxical decompositions
for a group action, following the classical route to the Banach–Tarski paradox:

* `Frontier.Equidecomposable G A B` : `A` and `B` are `G`-equidecomposable (Mathlib's
  `Equidecomp` structure is used as the underlying notion of a finite piecewise-`G` bijection).
* `Frontier.Paradoxical G E` : `E` contains two disjoint subsets, each `G`-equidecomposable
  with `E` itself.

Main results proved here:

* `Frontier.paradoxical_freeGroup` : the free group of rank two is paradoxical
  (acting on itself by left translation).  This is the combinatorial *base case* of
  Banach–Tarski.
* `Frontier.paradoxical_of_freeAction` : any set carrying a free action of the rank two
  free group is paradoxical.  (Hausdorff-type transfer principle, uses choice.)
* `Frontier.Banach_Tarski` : the Lean-checked geometric reduction: if the unit sphere in
  `ℝ³` is paradoxical under rotations, then the closed unit ball is paradoxical under
  isometries.
