# Hückel theory for the cycle `C₁₉`

We show that the spectrum of the adjacency matrix of the cycle graph `C₁₉`
(the Hückel matrix of the annulene `C₁₉` in units where `α = 0`, `β = 1`)
is exactly `{2 cos (2πk/19) : k = 0, …, 18}`.

The proof diagonalizes the circulant adjacency matrix by the discrete Fourier matrix.
