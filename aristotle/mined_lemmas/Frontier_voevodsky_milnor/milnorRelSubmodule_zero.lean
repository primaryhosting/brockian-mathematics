## Overview

This file formalises the statement of the *Milnor conjecture* (a theorem of Voevodsky):
for a field `F` of characteristic `≠ 2` the mod-`2` Milnor K-theory of `F` is isomorphic to the
mod-`2` (continuous) Galois cohomology of `F`,
`k^M_n(F) ≅ H^n(Gal(F_sep/F), ℤ/2)`.

We build both sides from scratch:

* `Frontier.MilnorKMod2 F n`, the degree-`n` part of mod-`2` Milnor K-theory, presented as the
  free `ℤ/2`-vector space on `n`-tuples of units of `F` modulo multilinearity and the Steinberg
  relation;
* `Frontier.contCohomologyMod2 G n`, the continuous (inhomogeneous) cochain cohomology of a
  topological group `G` with coefficients in the trivial module `ℤ/2`, applied to the absolute
  Galois group `Gal(F_sep/F)` equipped with the Krull topology.

`Frontier.MilnorConjecture F` is the resulting statement, and the target theorem
`Frontier.voevodsky_milnor` records the parts that are proved here:

1. the base case `n = 0`, for *every* field;
2. the full conjecture for separably closed fields of characteristic `≠ 2`;
3. a Lean-checked reduction of the degree-one case to Kummer theory: the degree-one part of
   mod-`2` Milnor K-theory is `Fˣ/(Fˣ)²`, so degree-one Milnor follows from the statement that the
   Kummer map `Fˣ/(Fˣ)² → H¹(Gal(F_sep/F), ℤ/2)` is an isomorphism.
