## Setting

Elad Lindenstrauss' *arithmetic quantum unique ergodicity* theorem concerns a congruence
surface `Γ \ ℍ` (or rather the unit tangent bundle `X = Γ \ PSL₂(ℝ)` of such a surface) and a
sequence of Hecke–Maass eigenforms `ψₙ`.  To each `ψₙ` one attaches its *microlocal lift*, a
probability measure `μₙ` on `X`, and the theorem asserts that `μₙ` converges in the weak-*
topology to the normalized volume (Liouville) measure `vol`.

The whole content of Lindenstrauss' proof is the *measure classification* step: any weak-*
limit of the microlocal lifts is a `PSL₂(ℝ)`-invariant, Hecke-recurrent measure of positive
entropy on every ergodic component, and every such measure equals `vol`.

The statement below is the Lean-checked *reduction* of quantum unique ergodicity to that
measure classification statement: on a compact space carrying its Borel σ-algebra (the unit
tangent bundle of a compact congruence surface is such a space), if **every** subsequential
weak-* limit of the sequence of microlocal lifts is the volume measure, then the full sequence
converges weak-* to the volume measure; equivalently, the "quantum averages"
`∫ f dμₙ` converge to the "classical average" `∫ f dvol` for every continuous observable `f`.

The two ingredients, both from Mathlib, are:

* `MeasureTheory.ProbabilityMeasure.instCompactSpace`: weak-* compactness of the space of
  probability measures on a compact metrizable space (Banach–Alaoglu / Prokhorov), together
  with its metrizability, which makes the weak-* topology first countable;
* `tendsto_nhds_of_unique_mapClusterPt`: in a compact space, a filter with a unique cluster
  point converges to it.

/-- **Arithmetic quantum unique ergodicity, Lean-checked reduction to measure classification
(Lindenstrauss).**

Let `X` be a compact metric space with its Borel σ-algebra — e.g. the unit tangent bundle
`Γ \ PSL₂(ℝ)` of a compact congruence surface — let `vol` be the normalized volume (Liouville)
probability measure on `X`, and let `μ : ℕ → ProbabilityMeasure X` be the sequence of microlocal
lifts of a sequence of Hecke–Maass eigenforms.

Assume the *measure classification* hypothesis established by Lindenstrauss: every weak-*
limit of a subsequence of `μ` is `vol`.  Then the full sequence equidistributes: `μ n → vol`
in the weak-* topology, and for every continuous observable `f : X → ℝ` the quantum averages
`∫ f dμ n` converge to the classical average `∫ f dvol`. -/

/-- **Equidistribution on the circle (unconditional).**  A sequence of probability measures on
`ℝ / ℤ` that is asymptotically invariant under all rotations converges weak-* to Lebesgue
measure, and the averages of every continuous observable converge to its mean. -/
