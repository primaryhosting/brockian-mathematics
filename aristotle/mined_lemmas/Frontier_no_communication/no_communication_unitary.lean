# The no-communication theorem (finite-dimensional base case)

A bipartite quantum system with Alice's finite-dimensional factor indexed by `A` and Bob's
by `B` is modelled by density matrices `Matrix (A × B) (A × B) ℂ`; an arbitrary (possibly
entangled) joint state is such a matrix `rho`.

Alice performs an arbitrary local operation: a quantum channel acting on her factor only,
given in Kraus form by operators `K i : Matrix A A ℂ` with `∑ i, (K i)ᴴ * K i = 1`
(this includes unitaries, and also measurements whose outcome is discarded).  The
corresponding operation on the joint system is
`rho ↦ ∑ i, (K i ⊗ₖ 1) * rho * (K i ⊗ₖ 1)ᴴ`, i.e. it acts as the identity on Bob's factor.

The main theorem `Frontier.no_communication` states that Bob's reduced density matrix — the
partial trace over Alice's factor — is completely unaffected by such an operation.
Consequently (`Frontier.no_communication_prob`, `Frontier.no_communication_indistinguishable`)
the probability of every outcome of every measurement Bob can perform is unchanged, so no
information whatsoever is transmitted by Alice's choice of local operation.
