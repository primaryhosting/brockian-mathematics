# Gleason Theorem

Target: Frontier.gleason_theorem
Verification: pending
Provenance: Aristotle theorem prover (Harmonic)

A *quantum measure* on a finite dimensional complex Hilbert space `ℂⁿ` is a map `μ` from the
orthogonal projections to `ℝ` which is nonnegative, finitely additive on orthogonal pairs, and
normalized (`μ 1 = 1`).  Gleason's theorem says that in dimension at least three every such `μ`
is given by the Born rule `μ P = Tr(ρ P)` for a unique density operator `ρ`.

This file contains:

* `Frontier.QuantumMeasure`, `Frontier.IsDensity`, `Frontier.Represents`: the formalized
  statement ingredients;
* `Frontier.born_rule_quantumMeasure`: every density operator gives a quantum measure;
* `Frontier.density_of_positive_linear`: a linear functional on matrices that is nonnegative
  on projections and normalized is the trace against a density operator;
* `Frontier.density_unique`: the density operator representing a measure is unique;
* `Frontier.gleason_theorem`: the Lean-checked reduction of Gleason's theorem to the linearity
  of the frame function (the analytic heart of the classical proof);
* `Frontier.gleason_fails_in_dimension_two`: an explicit quantum measure on the projections of
  `ℂ²` that is represented by no operator, showing that the dimension hypothesis is necessary.
