## Contents

* `Frontier.QuantumMeasure`: a finitely additive probability measure on the lattice of subspaces
  of a complex Hilbert space (equivalently, on orthogonal projections).
* `Frontier.IsDensityOperator`: self-adjoint, positive semidefinite, unit trace.
* `Frontier.gleason_theorem`: the target statement.  Gleason's theorem is derived, in a fully
  Lean-checked way, from Gleason's *frame function theorem* `hFrame` (the deep analytic input,
  taken here as an explicit hypothesis): every quantum measure on a space of dimension `≥ 3` is
  `U ↦ tr (ρ P_U)` for a density operator `ρ`.
* `Frontier.gleason_theorem_of_finrank_eq_one`: unconditional base case in dimension one.
* `Frontier.QuantumMeasure.ofDensity`: the converse direction, proved unconditionally -- every
  density operator defines a quantum measure through the Born rule.
* `Frontier.density_operator_unique`: the density operator is unique.
