# Valiant Permanent
Category: Frontier Cs
Target: CS.valiant_permanent
Verification: pending
Provenance: Aristotle theorem prover (Harmonic)

## Scope of the formalization

The statement "the `0/1` permanent is `#P`-complete" has two halves.  What is formalized here is

* the *membership* half, in full: the `0/1` permanent is the counting function of an explicitly
  constructed family of Boolean verifier circuits of polynomial size (`InSharpP perm01Count`);
* the combinatorial identity underlying the problem: the permanent of a `0/1` matrix is the
  number of perfect matchings of the associated bipartite graph;
* the weight-elimination step of Valiant's hardness argument: restricting to `0/1` entries loses
  no generality, since every matrix of natural numbers has the same permanent as a `0/1` matrix
  of controlled size.

The remaining half of Valiant's theorem, namely the parsimonious reduction of an arbitrary `#P`
verifier to a permanent (the gadget construction), is *not* formalized here.
