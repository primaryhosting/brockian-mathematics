## Scope of this formalization

Valiant's theorem states that the 0/1 permanent is `#P`-complete. This file develops:

* Boolean circuits with evaluation and size, and a definition of `#P` in its nonuniform
  circuit-verifier form (`CS.InSharpP`), of parsimonious reductions computed by
  polynomial-size circuits (`CS.ParsimoniousReduction`), and of `#P`-completeness
  (`CS.IsSharpPComplete`).
* The 0/1 permanent as a counting problem (`CS.permProblem`), its identification with
  `Matrix.permanent` of the encoded 0/1 matrix, and its identification with the problem of
  counting perfect matchings of a bipartite graph (`CS.matchingProblem`).
* A proof that the 0/1 permanent problem lies in `#P` (`CS.permProblem_inSharpP`), by an
  explicit polynomial-size verifier circuit family checking that the witness is a permutation
  matrix supported on the `1`-entries of the instance.
* `CS.valiant_permanent`: `#P`-completeness of the 0/1 permanent, given the `#P`-hardness of
  counting bipartite perfect matchings. That hardness — the combinatorial core of Valiant's
  original argument, proved there by an intricate gadget construction — is taken as an explicit
  hypothesis and is *not* formalized here.
