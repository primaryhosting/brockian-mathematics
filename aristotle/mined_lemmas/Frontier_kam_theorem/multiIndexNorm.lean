/-! ## Setting

We work with the standard "conjugacy" formulation of KAM theory.  The phase space is an
arbitrary type `P`, the `n`-dimensional torus is modelled by its universal cover
`Fin n → ℝ` (all objects below are invariant under the choice of representative, so
nothing is lost), and a *torus with rotation vector `ω`* for a dynamical system
`f : P → P` is an embedding `Ψ : (Fin n → ℝ) → P` satisfying the conjugacy equation

  `f (Ψ θ) = Ψ (θ + ω)`  for all `θ`,

i.e. `f` restricted to the image of `Ψ` is the rigid rotation by `ω`.

/-- `IsInvariantTorus n f ω Ψ` : the parametrised torus `Ψ` is invariant under the
dynamics `f` and the induced motion on it is the rigid rotation by the frequency
vector `ω`. -/

noncomputable def multiIndexNorm {n : ℕ} (k : Fin n → ℤ) : ℝ := ∑ i, |(k i : ℝ)|

/-- `ω` is `(γ, τ)`-Diophantine: its resonances `⟨k, ω⟩` are bounded away from `0`
polynomially in the size of `k`. -/
