  Brockian/SieveHamiltonian.lean — THE SIEVE HAMILTONIAN CAMPAIGN
  (July 30, after the "invent the dynamics" program note).

  The object: on the arithmetic wheel Z/M (M odd squarefree), the twin
  sieve deletes residues a with a ≡ 0 or a ≡ −2 mod some ℓ ∣ M. Once
  3 ∣ M the admissible set is pinned to the coset a ≡ 2 (mod 3); the
  residual translation flow is +3 on that coset. The compressed
  Hamiltonian (Dirichlet deletion of forbidden sites from the residual
  cycle) decomposes into path Laplacians over the admissible RUNS, so
  its spectrum is exact and finite. Everything below is finite; no
  Hilbert–Pólya claim is made anywhere in this file — the operator
  limit M → ∞ is an OPEN PROGRAM subject to the G0–G6 gate ladder.

  Charter as Core.lean. The declarations below are the formal campaign targets.
