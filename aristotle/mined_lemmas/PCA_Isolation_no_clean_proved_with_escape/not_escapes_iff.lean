Note on imports: the required header above must be the very first thing in the file, and
Lean forbids any `import` after a leading module doc-comment.  The development below is
therefore carried out in plain Lean 4 core (`Init`), with no Mathlib import; every notion
used (`List`, membership, decidability) is available there.

/-- A capability is an abstract resource token that the isolation engine mediates. -/

/-- An application, described by the list of capabilities it *declares* it will use.
This declaration is what the proof carried by the app talks about. -/

*grants* at run time. -/

/-- An execution trace is the list of capabilities exercised, in order. -/
abbrev Trace := List Cap

/-- A trace is *clean* for an app when every capability it exercises was declared. -/
