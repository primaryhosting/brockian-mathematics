## The isolation engine's model

A proof-carrying app is modelled as a small nondeterministic program `Prog`.
Running it emits *effects*: either the exercise of a capability (`Effect.cap`)
or the touching of a memory address (`Effect.mem`).

A `Sandbox` fixes which capabilities are granted and how large the isolated
memory region is.  An app *escapes* the sandbox if some reachable configuration
of its small-step operational semantics emits an effect the sandbox does not
permit.

The engine certifies apps in two independent ways:

* a **static capability scan** (`Clean`), a decidable syntactic check, and
* a **memory-safety certificate** (`Proved`), an inductive derivation shipped
  with the app.

The target theorem `no_clean_proved_with_escape` is the *soundness* of this
certification: no app can be clean, proved and still escape.  The converse,
`clean_and_proved_of_not_escapes`, is its *completeness*: every non-escaping
app is accepted by both certificates.  Both certificates are load-bearing and
the statement is non-vacuous; see the examples at the end of the file.

The development is self-contained (no imports), so that the file can begin with
the required header comment.
