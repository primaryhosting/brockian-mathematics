# Trace-norm bounds for matrix trigonometric functions

For an `n × n` complex matrix `A` we define the matrix cosine and matrix sine through the
matrix exponential,
`cos A = (exp (i A) + exp (-i A)) / 2` and `sin A = (exp (i A) - exp (-i A)) / (2 i)`.

The main results (`CosTraceNorm2707` and friends) bound the absolute value of the trace of these
matrices by the size `n` of the matrix, whenever `A` is Hermitian.  The proof goes through the
observation that `exp (± i A)` is unitary for Hermitian `A`, so that all of its entries have
absolute value at most `1`.
