# `Brockian.CosTraceNorm2707` : trace-norm bounds for cosine Gram matrices

For a family of angles `x : Fin n → ℝ` we consider the *cosine matrix*
`C i j = cos (x i - x j)`.  It is the Gram matrix of the unit vectors
`(cos (x i), sin (x i))` in the plane, hence positive semidefinite of rank at most `2`,
and all its diagonal entries equal `1`.

The main results are:

* `Brockian.cosMatrix_posSemidef` : `C` is positive semidefinite;
* `Brockian.traceNorm_of_posSemidef` : for a positive semidefinite matrix the trace norm
  (the sum of the absolute values of the eigenvalues) equals the trace;
* `Brockian.CosTraceNorm2707` : the trace norm of `C` equals `n`;
* derived trace-norm bounds: bounds on the quadratic and bilinear forms of `C`,
  and the general inequality `|trace A| ≤ ‖A‖₁` for Hermitian `A`.
