## Overview

A pure state of a bipartite quantum system `A ⊗ B` is described, in a product basis, by its
amplitude matrix `M : Matrix A B ℂ`, normalised so that `∑ a b, ‖M a b‖ ^ 2 = 1`.  The reduced
density matrix of the left half is `ρ_A = M * Mᴴ`, and the *entanglement entropy* across the cut
is the von Neumann entropy `-Tr ρ_A log ρ_A = ∑ᵢ negMulLog λᵢ` of its eigenvalues.

The entanglement *area law* in one dimension says that for a gapped local Hamiltonian the ground
state's entanglement entropy across a cut of the chain is bounded by a constant that does not grow
with the length of the chain (the "area" of a cut of a 1D chain being a single point).  The
mechanism, which is the content of Hastings' theorem, is that the gap forces the Schmidt rank
(equivalently, the matrix–product bond dimension) across the cut to be bounded by a constant `D`
independent of the system size.

Here we formalise the area law given that input: from a uniform bound `D` on the Schmidt rank
across the cut we derive the uniform entropy bound `log D`, valid for every chain length.  The
final theorem `Phys.area_law_1d` is stated for a family of chain states indexed by the number of
sites, and its conclusion is a bound that is *independent of the number of sites*.

Note on the file header: it is written as a plain block comment `/- ... -/` rather than a module
docstring `/-! ... -/`, because Lean requires all `import` commands to come before any module
docstring, so a `/-! ... -/` header on line 1 would make the file fail to compile.
