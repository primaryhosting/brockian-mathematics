Li's criterion states that the Riemann hypothesis holds iff the Li coefficients
`λ n = ∑_ρ (1 - (1 - 1/ρ)^n)` (the sum running over the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta
function) are nonnegative for all `n ≥ 1`.  The arithmetic input -- the Hadamard factorisation of
the completed zeta function, which identifies `λ n` with a sum over the zeros -- is not available
in Mathlib.  What is formalised and proved here, unconditionally and without any extra axioms, is
the function-theoretic core of the criterion for a finite zero multiset: for a finite family of
nonzero complex numbers stable under the functional-equation symmetry `ρ ↦ 1 - ρ`, all members lie
on the critical line iff all Li coefficients of the family are nonnegative.  The hard direction is
the Bombieri--Lagarias style argument: if some `1 - 1/ρ` lies outside the closed unit disc, then a
compactness (simultaneous Dirichlet approximation) argument produces arbitrarily large exponents
`d` for which all `d`-th powers point into the right half plane, and the largest one then makes
`λ d` negative.
