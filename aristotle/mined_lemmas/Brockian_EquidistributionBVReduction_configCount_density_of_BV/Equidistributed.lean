# Equidistribution and the bounded-variation reduction for configuration counts

Let `u : ℕ → ℝ` be a sequence which is *equidistributed* in the unit interval, in the sense
that averages of continuous test functions along `u` converge to the corresponding integral
over `[0,1]` (`Brockian.EquidistributionBVReduction.Equidistributed`).

The main result, `Brockian.EquidistributionBVReduction.configCount_density_of_BV`, upgrades
this from continuous test functions to the indicator of an interval `[a, b) ⊆ [0,1]`, which is
the basic function of bounded variation: the number of indices `n < N` with `u n ∈ [a, b)`
has density `b - a`.

The proof is the usual sandwich argument: the indicator of `[a, b)` is squeezed between two
continuous functions (produced by Urysohn's lemma) whose integrals differ from `b - a` by an
arbitrarily small amount.
