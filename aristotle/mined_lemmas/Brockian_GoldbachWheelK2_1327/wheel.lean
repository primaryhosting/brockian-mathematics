-- This module is deliberately import-free (Lean forbids `import` after the header
-- comment above), so primality is spelled out from first principles here.  The
-- companion module `RequestProject.GoldbachWheelK2_1327Mathlib` proves that
-- `Brockian.IsPrimeNat` coincides with Mathlib's `Nat.Prime`, and restates the
-- main theorem in Mathlib's vocabulary.

/-- Bool-level check that `n` splits as `p + (n - p)` with both parts prime and `p` in the
wheel. -/
