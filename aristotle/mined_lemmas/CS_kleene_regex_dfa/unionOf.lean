# Regular expressions define regular languages

This file proves the "easy" direction of Kleene's theorem: the language matched by a regular
expression is accepted by some DFA with finitely many states (`Language.IsRegular`).

The proof goes through the Myhill–Nerode characterisation
`Language.isRegular_iff_finite_range_leftQuotient`: a language is regular iff it has finitely
many left quotients.
