## The setting

Mathlib does not (yet) contain the theory of smooth projective complex varieties,
singular cohomology with its Hodge decomposition, or the cycle class map.  We therefore
formalize the Hodge conjecture in the standard *linear-algebra* form it takes once the
geometric input is available:

* `V` plays the role of the singular cohomology group `H^{2p}(X, ℚ)` of a smooth
  projective complex variety `X`;
* `ℂ ⊗[ℚ] V` is its complexification `H^{2p}(X, ℂ)`;
* a `HodgeStructure V w` is a Hodge decomposition of weight `w` on `V`, i.e. a
  bigrading `H^{a,b}` of `ℂ ⊗[ℚ] V` concentrated in bidegrees with `a + b = w`
  and exchanged by complex conjugation;
* `hodgeClasses H p` is the ℚ-subspace of *Hodge classes*: rational classes whose
  image in the complexification lies in the `(p,p)` piece;
* an `AlgebraicClasses H p` is a subspace `A` of classes of algebraic cycles; the
  geometric fact that algebraic cycle classes are Hodge classes is recorded as the
  field `alg_le_hodge`.

The Hodge conjecture then reads: `hodgeClasses H p ≤ A`, i.e. every Hodge class is a
rational combination of classes of algebraic cycles.
