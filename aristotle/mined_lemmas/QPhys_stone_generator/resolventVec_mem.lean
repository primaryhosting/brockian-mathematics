Stone's theorem: the infinitesimal generator of a strongly continuous one-parameter
unitary group on a complex Hilbert space is (essentially) the self-adjoint operator
`A` with `U t = exp (t * I * A)`; here we prove that the generator, defined as an
unbounded operator (a `LinearPMap`) on its natural domain, is self-adjoint.
