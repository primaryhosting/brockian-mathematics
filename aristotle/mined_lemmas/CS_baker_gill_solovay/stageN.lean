## Summary of the development

Everything is developed from scratch in this project:

* `CS.Stmt`, `CS.step`, `CS.run` (`RequestProject/BGS/Model.lean`): a concrete model of
  oracle computation.  Programs are statements of a small imperative language with
  string registers; oracle queries are built one symbol at a time in a dedicated query
  register, so that *the length of a query never exceeds the number of steps performed*.
* `CS.PClass`, `CS.NPClass` (`RequestProject/BGS/Classes.lean`): the relativized classes
  `P^O` and `NP^O`, defined with the polynomial bounds `pb k n = (n+2)^(k+1)`.
* `CS.A` (`RequestProject/BGS/OracleA.lean`): a self-referential oracle answering
  `NP^A`-questions in one query; well defined by recursion on the length of the queried
  string.  It satisfies `P^A = NP^A`.
* `CS.B` (`RequestProject/BGS/OracleB.lean`): an oracle built by stages, diagonalizing
  against every polynomial time oracle machine, for which the language
  `CS.Lang B = { x | ∃ u, |u| = |x| ∧ u ∈ B }` lies in `NP^B` but not in `P^B`.

/-- **Baker–Gill–Solovay**: there is an oracle `A` with `P^A = NP^A` and an oracle `B`
with `P^B ≠ NP^B`; hence no relativizing proof can settle the `P` versus `NP` question. -/
