# Baker Gill Solovay
Category: Frontier Cs
Target: CS.baker_gill_solovay

Verification: pending
Provenance: Aristotle theorem prover (Harmonic)

(The header block above is placed after the `import` lines because Lean 4 requires
`import` commands to come first in a file.)

The model of relativized computation is developed in `RequestProject.BGS.Model`:

* an *oracle* is a set of binary strings, `Oracle := Str → Bool`;
* an *oracle machine* `OM` is a pair of computable functions `ask`, `out`: `ask z l`
  returns the next query on input `z` (a pair of an input and a certificate) given the
  list `l` of oracle answers received so far, and `out z l` returns the verdict;
* `Bounded M k` says that all queries of `M` have length at most `(|x|+2)^k`, where `x`
  is the proper input, and a machine is run for `(|x|+2)^k` steps;
* `Po A L` (`L ∈ P^A`) and `NPo A L` (`L ∈ NP^A`) are the usual definitions, and
  `PClass A`, `NPClass A` are the corresponding classes of languages.

`RequestProject.BGS.PartA` builds an oracle `A` (by recursion on the length of strings)
which encodes acceptance of the `NP^A` computations, so that `P^A = NP^A`.

`RequestProject.BGS.PartB` builds an oracle `B` by diagonalization, so that the unary
language `LB = {1^n : B contains a string of length n}` lies in `NP^B` but not in `P^B`.
