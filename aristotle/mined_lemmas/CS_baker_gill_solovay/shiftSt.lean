## Basic properties of the machine model

* costs and query lists only grow;
* the cost of a run does not depend on the cost already accumulated (`run_shift`);
* every recorded query has length at most the cost, and there are at most `cost`
  many queries (`run_QInv`);
* locality: a run only depends on the oracle at the strings it queries
  (`run_local`).
