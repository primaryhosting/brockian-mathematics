/-- Key intermediate lemma: for an odd natural number `n`, the "half" appearing in the
exponent of quadratic reciprocity can be written either as `(n - 1) / 2` (natural
subtraction) or as `n / 2`; these agree. -/

/-- **Gauss's Law of Quadratic Reciprocity**: for distinct odd primes `p` and `q`,
`legendreSym p q * legendreSym q p = (-1) ^ ((p - 1) / 2 * ((q - 1) / 2))`. -/
