/-! ## The tent function and its Fourier transform

The proof of `∫ (sin x / x) ^ 2 dx = π` goes through Fourier inversion applied to the
tent (triangle) function `x ↦ max 0 (1 - |x|)`, whose Fourier transform is
`w ↦ (sin (π w) / (π w)) ^ 2`. -/

/-- The triangle (tent) function `x ↦ max 0 (1 - |x|)`, viewed as a complex-valued function. -/
