The statement "there exists a smooth manifold homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to `ℝ⁴`"
(Donaldson/Freedman) is formalized as `Frontier.ExoticEuclideanExists 4`.

The main theorem `Frontier.exotic_R4` is a Lean-checked reduction of that statement:

* the existence of a *small* exotic `ℝ⁴` (an open subset of `ℝ⁴` homeomorphic but not
  diffeomorphic to `ℝ⁴`, which is the form in which exotic `ℝ⁴`'s are usually produced)
  implies the existence of an exotic `ℝ⁴`;
* the existence of an exotic `ℝ⁴` is *equivalent* to the existence of a smooth structure on the
  topological space `ℝ⁴` itself which is not diffeomorphic to the standard one.

The dimension-zero base case, `Frontier.no_exotic_R0`, is proved outright: there is no
exotic `ℝ⁰`.
