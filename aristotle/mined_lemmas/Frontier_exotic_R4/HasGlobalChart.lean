## A criterion for a manifold to be diffeomorphic to its model space

The key reformulation: a `C^n` manifold `M` modelled on a normed space `E` is `C^n`-diffeomorphic
to `E` itself if and only if its maximal atlas contains a *global* chart, i.e. a chart whose
source is all of `M` and whose target is all of `E`.

  {E : Type*} [NormedAddCommGroup E] [NormedSpace 𝕜 E]
  {M : Type*} [TopologicalSpace M] [ChartedSpace E M]
  {n : WithTop ℕ∞}

/-- In the model space `E` (with the trivial model with corners `𝓘(𝕜, E)`), membership in the
`C^n` structure groupoid is just `C^n`-smoothness of the map and of its inverse. -/
