/-- `HasResolutionOfSingularities A` says that the affine variety `Spec A` admits a resolution of
its singularities inside its function field `K = Frac A`: there is a ring `B` with `A ⊆ B ⊆ K`
which is a finite `A`-module (so that `Spec B → Spec A` is a finite, hence proper, morphism), has
`K` as its fraction field (so that `Spec B → Spec A` is birational), and is regular, in the sense
that `B` is a Dedekind domain all of whose localizations at nonzero primes are discrete valuation
rings. -/
