open Set Metric

/-- A **quadratic-like map** in the sense of Douady–Hubbard: a holomorphic map
`f : U → V` between bounded connected open subsets of `ℂ` with `closure U ⊆ V`,
which is a branched covering of degree two (every fibre over `V` is a non-empty set of
at most two points, and some fibre has exactly two points). -/

theorem R_pos (hR : 1 + ‖c‖ < R) : 0 < R := by nlinarith [norm_nonneg c]

/-- Escape estimate: outside the disc of radius `R` the quadratic map increases the modulus
by at least the definite amount `R * (R - 1) - ‖c‖ > 0`. -/
