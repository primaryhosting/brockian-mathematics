/-! ## Quadratic-like maps

A *quadratic-like map* (Douady–Hubbard; the basic object of McMullen's work on
renormalization) is a holomorphic proper degree-two branched cover `f : U → V`
between open subsets of `ℂ` with `U` compactly contained in `V`.  The
degree-two condition is encoded concretely below: there is one critical value,
whose fiber is a single point, and every other value has exactly two
preimages. -/

/-- The quadratic family `z ↦ z ^ 2 + c`. -/

lemma iterate_qmap_zero (z : ℂ) (n : ℕ) : (qmap 0)^[n] z = z ^ (2 ^ n) := by
  induction n with
  | zero => simp
  | succ n ih =>
      rw [Function.iterate_succ_apply', ih]
      simp only [qmap, add_zero]
      rw [← pow_mul, pow_succ]

/-- **Base case of straightening.** For `c = 0` the filled Julia set is the
closed unit disk. -/
