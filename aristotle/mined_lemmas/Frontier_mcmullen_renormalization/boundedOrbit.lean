/-! ## Quadratic-like maps

A *quadratic-like map* (Douady–Hubbard; the basic object of McMullen's work on
renormalization) is a holomorphic proper degree-two branched cover `f : U → V`
between open subsets of `ℂ` with `U` compactly contained in `V`.  The
degree-two condition is encoded concretely below: there is one critical value,
whose fiber is a single point, and every other value has exactly two
preimages. -/
