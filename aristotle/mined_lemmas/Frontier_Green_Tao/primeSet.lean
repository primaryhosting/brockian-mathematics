The Green–Tao theorem: *the primes contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions.*

This file contains

* the formal statement (`Frontier.HasArbitrarilyLongAPs Frontier.primeSet`, unfolded in
  `Frontier.GreenTaoStatement`);
* two Lean-checked reductions of it to standard conjectures, `Frontier.Green_Tao` (from the
  Erdős–Turán conjecture on arithmetic progressions, via Mathlib's divergence of the sum of
  prime reciprocals) and `Frontier.Green_Tao_of_Dickson` (from Dickson's conjecture on
  simultaneous primality of linear forms);
* unconditional base cases, `Frontier.Green_Tao_base`: an arithmetic progression of `k` primes
  exists for every `k ≤ 13`.

Every hypothesis is an explicit argument of the corresponding theorem; no axiom is introduced.
