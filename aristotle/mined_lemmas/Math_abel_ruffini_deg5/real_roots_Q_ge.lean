The argument is the classical Galois-theoretic one: the quintic `X ^ 5 - 4 * X + 2` is
irreducible over `ℚ` (Eisenstein at `2`), has exactly `3` real roots and hence exactly
`2` non-real complex roots, so its Galois group is the full symmetric group on its `5`
complex roots, which is not solvable.  Consequently none of its roots is expressible by
radicals, i.e. the general quintic equation admits no solution formula in radicals.
