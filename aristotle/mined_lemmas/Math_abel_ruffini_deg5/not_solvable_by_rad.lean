The argument below is the classical Galois-theoretic proof of the Abel-Ruffini theorem
in degree 5, following the treatment of `Archive/Wiedijk100Theorems/AbelRuffini.lean`
in mathlib4 (author: Thomas Browning, Apache 2.0).  It is reproduced here in
self-contained form because the mathlib `Archive` library is not imported by default.

The key mathlib ingredients are:
* `solvableByRad.isSolvable'`  (an irreducible polynomial with a root solvable by radicals
  has solvable Galois group);
* `Polynomial.Gal.galActionHom_bijective_of_prime_degree'`  (an irreducible polynomial of
  prime degree with 1-3 non-real roots has full Galois group);
* `Equiv.Perm.not_solvable`  (the symmetric group on 5 letters is not solvable).

/-- **Abel-Ruffini in degree 5** (Galois-theoretic form): there is a monic irreducible
quintic over `ℚ` — namely `X ^ 5 - 4 * X + 2` — whose Galois group is not solvable, none of
whose complex roots is expressible by radicals, and which does have a complex root. -/
