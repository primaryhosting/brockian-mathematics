The development below is adapted from the Mathlib archive file
`Archive/Wiedijk100Theorems/AbelRuffini.lean` (Thomas Browning, Apache 2.0), which is not
importable from this project, and follows the classical Galois-theoretic proof of the Abel–Ruffini

theorem in degree five: the quintic `Φ a b = X ^ 5 - a * X + b` is irreducible over `ℚ`
by Eisenstein's criterion (for suitable `a`, `b`), has exactly three real roots and two
non-real roots, hence its Galois group is the full symmetric group `S₅`, which is not
solvable.  Consequently no root of this quintic is expressible by radicals.
