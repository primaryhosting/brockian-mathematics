The development below is adapted from the Mathlib archive file
`Archive/Wiedijk100Theorems/AbelRuffini.lean` (Thomas Browning, Apache 2.0), which is not
importable from this project, and follows the classical Galois-theoretic proof of the Abel–Ruffini

theorem monic_quinticPhi : (quinticPhi R a b).Monic :=
