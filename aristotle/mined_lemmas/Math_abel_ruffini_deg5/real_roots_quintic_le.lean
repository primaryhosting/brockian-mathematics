The development below follows the classical Galois-theoretic argument: the quintic
`X ^ 5 - 4 * X + 2` is irreducible over `ℚ` (Eisenstein at `2`), it has exactly two real roots
and five complex roots, hence its Galois group is the full symmetric group `S₅`, which is not
solvable.  Consequently no complex root of it is expressible by radicals.
