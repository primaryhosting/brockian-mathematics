Arrow's impossibility theorem.

A *preference* on a type of alternatives `A` is a linear order in the "weak" sense:
a total, transitive, antisymmetric relation `pref`, where `pref x y` reads
"`x` is at least as good as `y`".  `better x y` means `x` is strictly better than `y`.

A *social welfare function* is a map `F` from profiles (one preference per voter)
to a single preference.  Arrow's theorem says that with at least three alternatives and a
finite nonempty electorate, no such `F` can simultaneously satisfy unanimity (Pareto),
independence of irrelevant alternatives, and non-dictatorship.

The proof formalized here is the classical "decisive coalitions" argument:
the field-expansion lemma upgrades weak decisiveness over one pair to full decisiveness,
the contraction lemma splits a decisive coalition, and finiteness of the electorate then
produces a decisive singleton, i.e. a dictator.
