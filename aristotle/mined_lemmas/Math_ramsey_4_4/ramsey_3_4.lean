/-- `RamseyProp N p q` says: for every red/blue colouring of the edges of a complete graph
(the red edges being the edges of a simple graph `G`), every set `t` of at least `N` vertices
contains a red clique of size `p` or a blue clique of size `q`.
Here "blue" means an edge of the complement `Gᶜ`. -/
