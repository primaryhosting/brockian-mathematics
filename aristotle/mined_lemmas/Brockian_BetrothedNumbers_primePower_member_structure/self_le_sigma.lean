/-- `IsBetrothedPair m n` : `m` and `n` form a betrothed (quasi-amicable) pair, i.e. the sum of
the nontrivial divisors (all divisors except `1` and the number itself) of each equals the other.
Equivalently `σ m = σ n = m + n + 1`.

The classical definition additionally requires `m ≠ n`; that hypothesis is not needed for any of
the results below, so it is omitted here (making the statements slightly stronger). -/
