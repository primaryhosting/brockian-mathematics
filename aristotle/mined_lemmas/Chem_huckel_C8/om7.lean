The adjacency eigenvalues of the cycle graph `C₈` (the Hückel π-system of cyclooctatetraene)
are `2 cos (2πk/8)` for `k = 0, …, 7`.  This is expressed as a complete factorisation of the
characteristic polynomial of the adjacency matrix of `SimpleGraph.cycleGraph 8`.

The proof diagonalises the adjacency matrix by the discrete Fourier matrix built from the
primitive eighth root of unity `ω = (√2/2)(1 + i)`.
