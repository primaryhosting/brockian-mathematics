/-!
Mathlib does not state the `abc` conjecture. The closest existing material is
`UniqueFactorizationMonoid.radical` (`Mathlib/RingTheory/Radical.lean`), a general radical
of an element of a UFM, and the Mason–Stothers theorem
(`Mathlib/NumberTheory/FLT/MasonStothers.lean`), the polynomial analogue of `abc`.
Neither closes the statement below, so the radical for `ℕ` and both formulations of the
conjecture are set up here from scratch.

/-- The `abc` conjecture, finiteness form: for every `ε > 0` there are only finitely many
coprime triples `a + b = c` with `c > rad (a*b*c) ^ (1+ε)`. -/
