variable {n : ℕ}

/-- The permutation action of the dihedral group `DihedralGroup n` on the `n` vertices of the
regular `n`-gon (labelled by `ZMod n`): the rotation `r i` sends a vertex `x` to `x + i`, and the
reflection `sr i` sends `x` to `-i - x`. -/

theorem sum_vertexCharacter_r [NeZero n] :
    ∑ i : ZMod n, vertexCharacter n (.r i) = n := by
  simp [vertexCharacter_r]

/-- Summed over all reflections, the character contributes `n`: the fixed-point sets of the
reflections are exactly the fibres of the map `x ↦ -2x`. -/
