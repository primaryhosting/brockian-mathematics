# Decomposition of the vertex representation of a regular `n`-gon, `n` odd

For an odd number of vertices `n = 2m+1`, the permutation character of `DihedralGroup n`
acting on the vertices of the regular `n`-gon decomposes as the trivial character plus the
`m` two-dimensional characters `rotChar n 1, …, rotChar n m`.

For `n = 5` this is the classical pentagon statement `5 = 1 + 2 + 2`.
