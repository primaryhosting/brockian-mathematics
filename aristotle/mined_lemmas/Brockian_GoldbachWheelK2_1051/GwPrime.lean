/-- Primality, stated in the usual way: `p` is at least `2` and its only divisors are
`1` and `p`. (This file is self-contained, so the predicate is spelled out here.) -/

def GwPrime (p : Nat) : Prop :=
  2 ≤ p ∧ ∀ m : Nat, m ∣ p → m = 1 ∨ m = p

/-- Trial division by all candidate divisors `d ≤ 32`; correct for `p ≤ 1051`
since `33 * 33 = 1089 > 1051`. -/
