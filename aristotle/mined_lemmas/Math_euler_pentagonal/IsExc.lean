# Franklin's involution

Combinatorial core of Euler's pentagonal number theorem: the signed count of partitions of
`n` into distinct parts (sign `(-1)^(number of parts)`) is `0` unless `n` is a generalized
pentagonal number.

Partitions into distinct parts are encoded as finite sets of positive naturals.
