## Setup

We work with an elliptic curve over `ℚ` presented by an integral Weierstrass model
`W : WeierstrassCurve ℤ` (any elliptic curve over `ℚ` admits such a model).

* The *algebraic rank* is the rank of the Mordell–Weil group `E(ℚ)`, defined as the
  dimension of `ℚ ⊗_ℤ E(ℚ)` over `ℚ`.
* The *analytic rank* is the order of vanishing at `s = 1` of the Hasse–Weil `L`-function,
  where the `L`-function is specified by its Euler product on the half-plane of absolute
  convergence together with analytic continuation to `ℂ`.

Birch–Swinnerton-Dyer asserts that these two numbers agree.
