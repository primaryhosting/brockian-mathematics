/-! ## The arithmetic side: Mordell–Weil rank -/

/-- The Mordell–Weil group `E(ℚ)` of an integral Weierstrass model `W`, i.e. the group of
rational nonsingular points of the base change of `W` to `ℚ`. -/
abbrev MordellWeil (W : WeierstrassCurve ℤ) : Type := (W.baseChange ℚ).toAffine.Point

/-- The Mordell–Weil rank of `E(ℚ)`, defined as the dimension of `ℚ ⊗ℤ E(ℚ)` over `ℚ`.
For a finitely generated abelian group this is exactly the rank of its free part. -/

/-- The Hasse–Weil `L`-function of `W`, if it exists, is unique: this is the identity principle
applied to two entire functions agreeing on the half-plane of convergence. Hence
`Frontier.BSD_statement` is a well-posed assertion about `E`. -/
