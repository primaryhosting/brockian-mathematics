# Symmetric operators, deficiency spaces and the basic criterion of essential self-adjointness

This file develops the small amount of unbounded-operator theory that is needed to state and
prove that a Schrödinger operator is essentially self-adjoint.

An *operator with domain `D`* on a complex Hilbert space `H` is encoded here as a pair of
linear maps `ι T : D →ₗ[ℂ] H`, where `ι` describes how the (abstract) domain `D` sits inside
`H` and `T` is the action of the operator.  (Taking `D` to be a submodule of `H` and `ι` its
inclusion recovers the usual picture; the extra generality is convenient because the natural
domain of a Schrödinger operator is a space of Schwartz functions.)

The main definition is `Brockian.Weyl.IsEssentiallySelfAdjoint`, which is the classical *basic
criterion* of von Neumann (see e.g. Reed–Simon, *Methods of Modern Mathematical Physics I*,
Theorem VIII.3): a densely defined symmetric operator is essentially self-adjoint if and only
if the ranges of `T + i` and `T - i` are dense.  The theorem
`Brockian.Weyl.dense_range_smul_sub_iff_deficiency` records the equivalent formulation in terms
of the *deficiency spaces*: no nonzero `v ∈ H` solves the weak (adjoint) equation `T* v = ∓ i v`.

The remaining results are the analytic tools used later:

* `Brockian.Weyl.norm_add_I_smul_lower_bound`: the basic lower bound `‖T x + i b ι x‖ ≥ |b| ‖ι x‖`
  for a symmetric operator;
* `Brockian.Weyl.dense_range_add_of_relatively_bounded`: a small perturbation lemma, which is the
  engine both of the Kato–Rellich argument and of the transfer of density in the spectral
  parameter;
* `Brockian.Weyl.dense_range_shift_of_dense_range_shift`: density of the range of `T + i b'`
  follows from density of the range of `T + i b` whenever `|b' - b| < b`.
