# Trace-norm bounds for the matrix cosine and sine (`CosTraceNorm` family)

This file develops, from scratch, the Schatten 1-norm (trace norm) of a complex square matrix,
the Hermitian functional calculus `Brockian.hermFun`, and proves a family of trace-norm bounds
for the matrix cosine and sine of a Hermitian matrix.
