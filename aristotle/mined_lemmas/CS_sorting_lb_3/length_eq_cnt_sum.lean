Any comparison sort of 3 elements needs at least `⌈log₂ (3!)⌉ = 3` comparisons in the
worst case.

The development below is self-contained (core Lean 4 only, so that the required header
comment can be the first thing in the file, since Lean demands that `import` commands
precede every other command).

Model.  A comparison sort of three elements is modelled as a binary decision tree
(`DTree`): an internal node `cmp i j l r` compares the keys sitting at positions `i` and
`j` of the input and branches on the outcome, and a leaf `leaf q` reports the ordering
`q` it has determined.  An input is one of the `3! = 6` possible orderings of three
distinct keys (`Ord3`), `rank o i` being the rank of the key at position `i`.  The tree
sorts correctly when, on every input `o`, it reports exactly `o`.  `depth t` is the
worst-case number of comparisons the tree performs.
