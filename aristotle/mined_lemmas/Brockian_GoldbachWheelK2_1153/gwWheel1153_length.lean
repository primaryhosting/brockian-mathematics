This file is deliberately self-contained and uses no imports, so that the header
comment above can be the very first thing in the file: Lean requires `import`
commands to precede every other command, including module documentation.
Consequently primality is developed from scratch here, as `Brockian.IsPrimeNat`.
The companion file `RequestProject/GoldbachWheelK2_1153Mathlib.lean` imports
Mathlib, proves `IsPrimeNat n ↔ Nat.Prime n`, and restates the main result in
Mathlib's vocabulary.

/-- `IsPrimeNat n` is the usual definition of primality for natural numbers:
`n` is at least `2` and its only divisors are `1` and `n`. -/
