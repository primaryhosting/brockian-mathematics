## Contents

The Hückel (tight-binding) Hamiltonian of the cyclic polyene `C₁₆` is `α + β A`, where `A` is the
adjacency matrix of the cycle graph `C₁₆`.  We show that the characteristic polynomial of `A`
factors as `∏_{k=0}^{15} (X - 2 cos (2 π k / 16))`, i.e. that the adjacency eigenvalues of `C₁₆`,
listed with multiplicity, are exactly `2 cos (2 π k / 16)` for `k = 0, …, 15`.

The proof diagonalises the (circulant) adjacency matrix by the discrete Fourier matrix built from
the standard additive character `ZMod.stdAddChar` of `ZMod 16`; the orthogonality relation used is
`AddChar.sum_mulShift`, and the invariance of the characteristic polynomial under conjugation comes
from `Matrix.charpoly_mul_comm`.
