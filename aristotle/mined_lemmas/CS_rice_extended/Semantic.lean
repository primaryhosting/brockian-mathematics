## Rice's theorem, extended form

We work with `Nat.Partrec.Code`, Mathlib's type of indices (codes) for partial recursive
functions `ℕ →. ℕ`, where `Code.eval : Code → (ℕ →. ℕ)` is the universal evaluation map.

A set `C` of codes is *semantic* if membership depends only on the partial function
computed, and *nontrivial* if it is neither empty nor everything.  Rice's theorem says
that such a `C` is never recursive.

The main theorem `CS.rice_extended` is proved directly from Kleene's recursion (fixed
point) theorem, and we then derive several extended forms: the complement is not
recursive either, the index-set formulation for a property of partial functions, and
the concrete instance that halting on a fixed input is undecidable.
