## Overview

We work with unbounded operators on a complex inner product space `H`, presented as linear maps
`T : D →ₗ[ℂ] H` out of a submodule `D` (the operator domain).

For a densely defined symmetric operator `T`, essential self-adjointness is equivalent to the
symmetry of the adjoint `T†` (equivalently: `T† = T††`, i.e. the closure `T̄ = T††` is
self-adjoint).  Since the adjoint of an unbounded operator is only defined on the set of vectors
`y` for which a representing vector `z` exists, we encode `z = T† y` through the relation
`IsAdjointPair T y z`, and encode symmetry of `T†` as `AdjointIsSymmetric T`.  This avoids any
use of choice and is exactly the classical criterion.

The main result is the (bounded) Kato–Rellich theorem in the concrete Schrödinger setting: on
`L²(ℝ)`, if the kinetic part `T` (e.g. `-d²/dx²` on a core such as `Cc^∞` or the Schwartz space)
is essentially self-adjoint, then adding a potential `V` of *weak regularity* — merely a.e. measurable
and essentially bounded, with no continuity or differentiability assumed — preserves essential
self-adjointness. In particular the deficiency spaces of the Schrödinger operator `-Δ + V` are
trivial, i.e. its deficiency indices vanish (Weyl's deficiency-index criterion).
