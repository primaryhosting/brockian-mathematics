# Essential self-adjointness of Schrödinger operators via deficiency indices

This file develops, from scratch:

* a minimal framework for (possibly unbounded) operators on a complex Hilbert space,
  given as a linear map `T : D →ₗ[ℂ] H` out of a submodule `D` of `H`, together with
  their graphs, adjoint graphs, symmetry and essential self-adjointness;
* the *basic criterion* of essential self-adjointness: a densely defined symmetric
  operator whose deficiency spaces `ker (T* ∓ i)` are trivial is essentially
  self-adjoint;
* the deficiency ("Weyl limit point") analysis of the second order difference
  equation attached to a discrete Schrödinger operator, and the resulting
  essential self-adjointness of the discrete Schrödinger operator
  `(T u) n = u (n-1) + u (n+1) + V n * u n` on `ℓ²(ℤ, ℂ)`, defined on the
  (dense) span of the standard basis vectors, for an **arbitrary** real potential
  `V : ℤ → ℝ`.

The main theorem
`schrodinger_essentiallySelfAdjoint_of_weakRegularity` is unconditional: no regularity
(or boundedness) hypothesis on the potential is needed, so the classical weak regularity
assumption is discharged. Everything is proved from first principles on top of Mathlib;
in particular the framework for unbounded operators, their adjoints and essential
self-adjointness is built here.
