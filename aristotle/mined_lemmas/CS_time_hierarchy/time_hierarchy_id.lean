## Overview

This file is self-contained: it depends on nothing but the Lean core library.

We set up a concrete model of computation.  Inputs are natural numbers, programs are
natural numbers as well (a code is read as `pair tag args`, so that every natural number
is a program), and `eval k c x` runs the program `c` on input `x` with a budget of `k`
steps.  The instruction set contains the basic arithmetic and pairing operations, a
conditional, an unbounded loop, and one universal instruction which runs a given program
on a given input under a given step budget, at the cost of that budget plus one step.

`InTime t L` says that the language `L : Nat → Bool` is decided by some program within
`t x` steps on every input `x`.  Since running a program with more fuel gives the same
result (`eval_mono`), these classes grow with `t`.

The main result `CS.time_hierarchy` is the time hierarchy theorem for this model: if the
time bound `t` is itself computable within time `b`, and `T x ≥ t x + b x + 8`, then
every language decidable in time `t` is decidable in time `T`, and some language --
the diagonal language `diagLang t` -- is decidable in time `T` but not in time `t`.
