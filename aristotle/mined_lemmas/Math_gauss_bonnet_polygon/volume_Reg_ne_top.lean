# Girard's relation for a solid cone over a spherical triangle

Given three vectors `u v w` in `ℝ³` in general position, the region
`Reg u v w`, the part of the unit ball where the three linear forms `⟪u,·⟫`, `⟪v,·⟫`, `⟪w,·⟫`
are nonnegative, has volume `((π - angle v w) + (π - angle u w) + (π - angle u v) - π)/3`.

This is Girard's theorem in disguise: the three quantities `π - angle · ·` are the dihedral
angles of the cone, and three times the volume of the cone is the area of the spherical
triangle it cuts out on the unit sphere.
