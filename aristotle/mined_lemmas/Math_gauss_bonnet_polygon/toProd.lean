# Volume of a wedge in three-dimensional space

The main result of this file is `SphericalArea.volume_wedge`: for a unit vector `u` and two
linearly independent vectors `s`, `t` orthogonal to `u`, the set of points of the open unit ball
whose orthogonal projection to `u^⊥` lies in the double wedge spanned by `s` and `t` has volume
`4 * angle s t / 3`.
