# Gauss Bonnet Polygon

Category: Pure Mathematics.  Target: `Math.gauss_bonnet_polygon`.

## Overview

We prove Girard's theorem (the Gauss–Bonnet theorem for a geodesic triangle on the unit
sphere): the sum of the three interior angles of a spherical triangle equals `π` plus the
area of the triangle.

The area of a region `S` of the unit sphere in `ℝ³` is defined as three times the Lebesgue
volume of the cone over `S` with apex the origin (this is the standard normalisation: the
cone over the whole sphere is the unit ball, of volume `4π/3`, giving total area `4π`).

The proof is the classical "lune" argument.  The three great circles through the pairs of
vertices cut the sphere into eight triangles; each of the three lunes containing the
triangle `T` decomposes as `T` together with one of the neighbouring triangles.
