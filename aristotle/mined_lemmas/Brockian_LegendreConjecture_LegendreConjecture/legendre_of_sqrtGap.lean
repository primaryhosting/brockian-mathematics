# Legendre Conjecture
Category: Brockian Conjecture
Target: Brockian.LegendreConjecture.LegendreConjecture
Verification: pending
Provenance: Aristotle theorem prover (Harmonic)

Legendre's conjecture — "there is always a prime between two consecutive squares" — is a
well-known open problem.  This file therefore does what can be done rigorously:

* it states the conjecture (`LegendreStatement`);
* it gives several **equivalent reformulations**, including the contrapositive
  ("no prime-free interval between consecutive squares"), a formulation via the
  next-prime function, and a formulation via the prime counting function;
* it gives **conditional reductions**: Legendre's conjecture follows from Andrica's
  conjecture (`LegendreConjecture`, the target theorem) and from a `√m`-size prime gap
  hypothesis;
* it proves **unconditional partial results**: a weakened Bertrand-type version, and a
  verification of the conjecture for all `n ≤ 30`.

/-- **Legendre's conjecture**: for every `n ≥ 1` there is a prime strictly between
`n ^ 2` and `(n + 1) ^ 2`. -/
