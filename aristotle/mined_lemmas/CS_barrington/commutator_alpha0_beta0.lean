# Basic definitions for Barrington's theorem

* Boolean formulas over the basis `{¬, ∧, ∨}` (with constants), together with their
  depth and semantics.  Non-uniform `NC¹` is the class of families of boolean functions
  computed by formulas of logarithmic depth.
* Width-5 permutation branching programs: a program is a list of instructions, each of
  which reads one input bit and outputs one of two permutations of `Fin 5` (or is a
  constant instruction).  The value of the program is the product of the permutations
  produced by its instructions, and the program accepts iff this product lies in a
  designated set of accepting permutations.
