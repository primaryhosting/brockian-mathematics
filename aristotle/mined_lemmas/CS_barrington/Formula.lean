## Barrington's theorem

We formalise Barrington's theorem, which identifies `NC¹` (log-depth boolean formulas)
with width-`5` permutation branching programs:

* **Forward direction.** Every boolean formula of depth `d` is computed by a width-`5`
  permutation branching program of length at most `4 ^ d` (in the strong sense of
  `σ`-computation, for an arbitrary `5`-cycle `σ`).
* **Converse direction.** Every width-`5` permutation branching program of length at
  most `2 ^ k` is computed by a boolean formula of depth `O(k)` (explicitly `6 * k + 4`).

Together these say: depth-`d` formulas ↔ length-`4^d` width-`5` programs, i.e.
`NC¹` = width-`5` permutation branching programs.

and apply one of two permutations of the `5` states depending on the answer. -/
