## Barrington's theorem

We formalise Barrington's theorem, which identifies the class `NC¹` (Boolean formulas of
logarithmic depth) with the class of functions computed by *width-5 permutation branching
programs* of polynomial length.

* `CS.Formula n` are Boolean formulas in the variables `Fin n` built from `¬`, `∧`, `∨`.
  Following the usual convention for Barrington's theorem, `Formula.depth` counts the
  nesting depth of the binary gates (negations are free, since they can be pushed to the
  leaves without changing the depth).
* `CS.BProg n` is a *width-5 permutation branching program*: a list of instructions, each of
  which reads one input bit and outputs one of two permutations of `Fin 5`, depending on the
  value of that bit.  The value `BProg.eval P x` of the program on the input `x` is the
  product of the permutations selected by the instructions.

The two halves of `CS.barrington` are:

1. every formula of depth `d` is computed by a width-5 permutation branching program of
   length at most `4 ^ d`, with output the prescribed 5-cycle `σ` on accepted inputs and the
   identity on rejected inputs (this is Barrington's construction);
2. conversely, for every width-5 permutation branching program `P` of length `ℓ` and every
   target permutation `σ`, the acceptance predicate `P.eval x = σ` is computed by a formula of
   depth `O(log ℓ)` (a balanced divide-and-conquer evaluation of the product).
