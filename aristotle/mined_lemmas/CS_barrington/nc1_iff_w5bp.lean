## Barrington's theorem

We formalise Barrington's theorem: the class of Boolean function families computed by
logarithmic-depth fan-in-two Boolean circuits (`NC¹`) coincides with the class of families
computed by polynomial-length width-`5` permutation branching programs.

* `CS.Barrington.Circuit` : fan-in two Boolean circuits over `{¬, ∧, ∨}` and constants.
* `CS.Barrington.Instr`, `CS.Barrington.run` : width-5 permutation branching programs,
  i.e. lists of instructions, each of which multiplies the running value in `S₅` by a
  permutation depending on (at most) one input bit.
* `CS.Barrington.NC1` and `CS.Barrington.W5BP` : the two classes.
* `CS.barrington` : the two classes are equal.
