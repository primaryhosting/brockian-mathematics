## Overview

We formalise Barrington's theorem in the following form.

* A Boolean function family `f n : (Fin n → Bool) → Bool` is *in NC¹* (`CS.InNC1`) when it is
  computed by Boolean formulas (constants, `¬`, fan-in-two `∧`, `∨`) of depth `O(log n)`.
  A formula of depth `d` has at most `2 ^ d` leaves, so this is the usual class of
  logarithmic-depth fan-in-two circuits / polynomial-size formulas.
* A *width-5 permutation branching program* (`CS.Prog`) is a finite sequence of instructions,
  each of which queries one input variable and applies one of two permutations of the five
  states `Fin 5`; the program computes the ordered product of these permutations, and accepts
  an input when the image of the start state `0` lies in a designated set of accepting states.
  `CS.InW5BP` asks for such programs of polynomial length.

The main theorem `CS.barrington` states that the two classes coincide. The two directions are
proved with explicit resource bounds: a formula of depth `d` is turned into a program of length
at most `4 ^ d` (`CS.exists_prog`, via the 5-cycle commutator construction `CS.exists_comp`),
and a program of length at most `2 ^ k` is simulated by a formula of depth at most `4 * k + 4`
(`CS.progFormula_eval`, `CS.progFormula_depth`, via a balanced divide-and-conquer evaluation of
the product of the instruction permutations).
