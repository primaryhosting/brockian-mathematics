# Preference relations for Arrow's impossibility theorem

`Pref A` is a weak preference relation on the set of alternatives `A`: a total preorder,
where `r.le a b` means "`b` is at least as good as `a`" (higher is better).

`LinPref A` is a *ranking*: a weak preference with no ties (an antisymmetric total preorder,
i.e. a linear order).

This file develops the basic API together with the constructions of rankings that are used
in the proof of Arrow's theorem.
