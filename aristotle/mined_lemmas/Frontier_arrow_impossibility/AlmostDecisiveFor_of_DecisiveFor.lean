Provenance: Aristotle theorem prover (Harmonic)

A ranked voting rule (social welfare function) turns a profile of individual rankings of the
alternatives into a social ranking.  Arrow's theorem says that as soon as there are at least
three alternatives, no such rule can be unanimous (Pareto), independent of irrelevant
alternatives, and non-dictatorial at the same time.

The key intermediate result is the *field expansion* / contagion lemma
`Frontier.decisive_of_almostDecisiveFor`: a coalition that gets its way on one ordered pair of
alternatives against unanimous opposition is decisive for *every* ordered pair.  A minimal
decisive coalition is then shown to be a singleton, i.e. a dictator.
