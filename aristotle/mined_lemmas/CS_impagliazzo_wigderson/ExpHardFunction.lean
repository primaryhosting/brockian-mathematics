This file is deliberately written without any `import`, because the required header above is a
module doc comment and Lean does not allow `import` commands after it.  All notions below are
therefore developed from scratch in core Lean 4.

Probabilities over `k` random bits are represented exactly by integer counts: instead of saying
that the acceptance probability is at least `2/3` we say `2 * 2 ^ m ≤ 3 * (number of accepting
random strings)`, and similarly for the other bounds.  This is an exact (not approximate)
reformulation, and it avoids any need for rational arithmetic.
