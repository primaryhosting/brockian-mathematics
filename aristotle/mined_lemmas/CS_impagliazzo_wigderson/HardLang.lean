This development is deliberately self-contained (it uses only the Lean 4 core library),
so that the file can literally begin with the header comment above.

Encoding conventions:
* an input of length `n` is a natural number `x` (thought of as the bit string
  `x.testBit 0, …, x.testBit (n-1)`);
* a random string of length `r` is a natural number `ρ < 2 ^ r`;
* probabilities are handled by counting: `count r f` is the number of strings of length `r`
  on which `f` returns `true`, and a probability statement `p ≥ 2/3` is written as
  `2 * 2 ^ r ≤ 3 * count r f`.
