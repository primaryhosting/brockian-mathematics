This file is deliberately written without any `import`, because the required header above is a
module doc comment and Lean does not allow `import` commands after it.  All notions below are
therefore developed from scratch in core Lean 4.

Probabilities over `k` random bits are represented exactly by integer counts: instead of saying
that the acceptance probability is at least `2/3` we say `2 * 2 ^ m ≤ 3 * (number of accepting
random strings)`, and similarly for the other bounds.  This is an exact (not approximate)
reformulation, and it avoids any need for rational arithmetic.

/-- A randomized algorithm: it reads an input string and a random string, the latter encoded as
a natural number `r < 2 ^ m`, where `m` is the number of random bits used. -/

/-- A deterministic algorithm. -/

  3 * acceptCount A x m ≤ 2 ^ m

/-- The generator `G`, run on all seeds of length `s`, fools the test `A(x, ·)` up to error
`1/12`: the two acceptance probabilities `genAcceptCount / 2 ^ s` and `acceptCount / 2 ^ m`
differ by at most `1/12`. -/
