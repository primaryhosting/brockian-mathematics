## Betrothed (quasi-amicable) numbers

A pair `(m, n)` of distinct positive integers is *betrothed* (or *quasi-amicable*,
or a *reduced amicable pair*) when

  `σ m = σ n = m + n + 1`,

i.e. each of `m` and `n` is the sum of the *nontrivial* proper divisors of the other.
The smallest example is `(48, 75)`.

Whether there are infinitely many betrothed pairs is an open problem, so the target
theorem `BetrothedInfinitude` is stated here as a **Lean-checked conditional
reduction**: infinitude of betrothed pairs follows from a prime-pattern hypothesis
`PrimePatternUnbounded`, which asks for arbitrarily large solutions of a pair of
`σ`-equations in which the two "new" factors are primes.

The hypothesis is *not* vacuous: `isBetrothedPattern_16_25_3_3` exhibits the
solution `(a, b, p, q) = (16, 25, 3, 3)`, which produces the betrothed pair
`(48, 75)`.

Alongside the reduction, several unconditional facts are proved: the first three
betrothed pairs, that no member of a betrothed pair is prime, that both members are
at least `48`, that the set of betrothed pairs is infinite exactly when betrothed
numbers are unbounded, and a parity restriction (in a betrothed pair whose two members
have the same parity, each member is a square or twice a square).
