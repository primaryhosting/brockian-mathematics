# The completed zeta / Riemann ξ functional equation and the ζ ↔ ξ zero correspondence

This file wires Mathlib 4.32's *unconditional* completed-zeta functional equation
`completedRiemannZeta (1 - s) = completedRiemannZeta s` into the Brockian
`RiemannScaffold` ξ-normalization `ξ(s) = s (s-1) Λ(s)`, and then proves the full
zero correspondence between the completed function ξ and the Riemann zeta ζ.

## What is proved (all UNCONDITIONAL)

* `completedRiemannZeta_functional_equation` — Mathlib's `Λ(1-s) = Λ(s)`, restated
  at the Brockian import boundary.
* `riemannXi_apply` — the definitional connection `ξ(s) = s (s-1) Λ(s)` made an
  explicit lemma so downstream files never need to `unfold`.
* `riemannXi_functional_equation` — the classical **ξ functional equation**
  `ξ(1-s) = ξ(s)`, derived from Mathlib's completed-zeta symmetry plus the
  polynomial factor `s(s-1)` (which is itself invariant under `s ↦ 1-s`).
* `zeta_zero_of_riemannXi_zero` — the *converse* zero direction: a ξ-zero away from
  the explicit factor points `s = 0, 1` forces `ζ(s) = 0`.  (RiemannScaffold already
  supplies the forward direction `riemannXi_eq_zero_of_nontrivial_zeta_zero`.)
* `riemannXi_eq_zero_iff_zeta_zero_of_mem_critical_strip` — inside the open critical
  strip `0 < Re s < 1` the two zero sets coincide **exactly**: `ξ(s) = 0 ↔ ζ(s) = 0`.
  In the strip the trivial-zero lattice and the factor points `s = 0, 1` are all
  absent, so no artifacts intervene.
* `zeta_zero_one_sub_of_mem_critical_strip` — the reflection corollary: a nontrivial
  ζ-zero in the strip has its mirror `1-s` as a ζ-zero as well (also in the strip).

## What is NOT proved

* **Nothing conditional is claimed as unconditional.**  This file does not touch RH,
  the location of the nontrivial zeros, or the `BrockianSystem` Hilbert–Pólya schema
  of `RiemannScaffold` Part 2.  It supplies only the genuine (Mathlib-backed)
  functional equation and the exact ζ ↔ ξ zero dictionary in the critical strip.
* The correspondence is stated for the *open* strip `0 < Re s < 1`; the boundary
  lines `Re s ∈ {0, 1}` and the trivial-zero lattice are deliberately outside scope
  (there the factor `s(s-1)` and `Λ`'s poles produce the well-known artifacts, which
  `RiemannScaffold` already documents).

/-- **The ξ-bridge (UNCONDITIONAL).**  If every zero of `ξ` other than the two
lattice artifacts `s = 0, 1` (which come from the explicit `s (s-1)` factor over
`ℂ`, not from `Λ`) lies on the critical line, then the Riemann Hypothesis holds
as Mathlib states it.

The hypothesis is the honest ξ-form of RH: it is NOT assumed, and it is not
vacuous — it is exactly the (open) assertion that the nontrivial zeros lie on the
line.  The implication does real work through
`riemannXi_eq_zero_of_nontrivial_zeta_zero`. -/
