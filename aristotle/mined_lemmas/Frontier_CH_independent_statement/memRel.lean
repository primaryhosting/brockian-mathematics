/-! ## Part 1: the Continuum Hypothesis as a statement about cardinals

Inside Lean's own (ZFC-like) ambient set theory we can state CH directly:
there is no cardinal strictly between `ℵ₀` and `𝔠 = 2 ^ ℵ₀`.  We check that this
is equivalent to the usual formulation `𝔠 = ℵ₁`, and to the "no set of reals of
intermediate cardinality" formulation.  These equivalences are theorems of ZFC
(they are proved outright below); it is CH itself that is independent. -/

/-- The Continuum Hypothesis, stated for cardinals: no cardinal lies strictly
between `ℵ₀` and the cardinality of the continuum. -/

/-- The language of set theory: no function symbols, a single binary relation symbol `∈`. -/
