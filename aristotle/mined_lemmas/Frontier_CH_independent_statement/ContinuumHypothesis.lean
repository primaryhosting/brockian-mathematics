/-! ## Part 1: the Continuum Hypothesis as a statement about cardinals

We first record the "external" form of CH — the statement, about the actual real
numbers, that every uncountable set of reals has the cardinality of the continuum —
and prove that it is equivalent to the usual cardinal arithmetic form `ℵ₁ = 𝔠`.
This is a genuine (and fully proved) Lean theorem; it is the base case of the
formalization. -/

/-- The Continuum Hypothesis, in the form: every uncountable set of real numbers has
cardinality the continuum. -/

def ContinuumHypothesis : Prop :=
  ∀ s : Set ℝ, ¬ s.Countable → #s = 𝔠

/-- The Continuum Hypothesis is equivalent to the cardinal equation `ℵ₁ = 𝔠`. -/
