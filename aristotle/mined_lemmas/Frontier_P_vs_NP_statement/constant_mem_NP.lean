## Overview

This file is a self-contained formalisation (it needs no imports beyond the Lean core
prelude, so that the module header above can literally begin the file) of:

* single-tape Turing machines over the binary alphabet, deterministic (`Frontier.DTM`) and
  nondeterministic (`Frontier.NTM`), with a *finite* state set `Fin (states + 1)`;
* their step semantics on a two-way infinite tape `Int → Sym`;
* time-bounded decision of a language, and the complexity classes `Frontier.P` and
  `Frontier.NP`;
* polynomial-time computable functions, Karp (polynomial-time many-one) reducibility
  `Frontier.PolyReducible`, NP-hardness and NP-completeness.

The target declaration `Frontier.P_vs_NP_statement` states the precise content of the
assertion `P ≠ NP`: the classes differ exactly when some language is decided by a
polynomial-time nondeterministic Turing machine but by no polynomial-time deterministic one.
The theorem is the conjunction of the (proved) inclusion `P ⊆ NP` with pure logic; the
assertion `P ≠ NP` itself is of course open, and is *not* proved here.

/-! ## The statement -/

/-- **The P vs NP statement.** The complexity classes `P` and `NP` are different precisely
when there exists a language which is decided by some polynomial-time *nondeterministic*
Turing machine but by no polynomial-time *deterministic* Turing machine.

Whether this holds is the (open) P vs NP problem; the theorem below only makes the assertion
precise, by showing it equivalent to the existence of such a separating language. Its proof
combines pure logic with the inclusion `P ⊆ NP`, i.e. `Frontier.P_subset_NP`. -/
