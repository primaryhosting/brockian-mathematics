## Overview

This file is a self-contained formalisation (it needs no imports beyond the Lean core
prelude, so that the module header above can literally begin the file) of:

* single-tape Turing machines over the binary alphabet, deterministic (`Frontier.DTM`) and
  nondeterministic (`Frontier.NTM`), with a *finite* state set `Fin (states + 1)`;
* their step semantics on a two-way infinite tape `Int → Sym`;
* time-bounded decision of a language, and the complexity classes `Frontier.P` and
  `Frontier.NP`;
* polynomial-time computable functions, Karp (polynomial-time many-one) reducibility
  `Frontier.PolyReducible`, NP-hardness and NP-completeness.

The target declaration `Frontier.P_vs_NP_statement` states the precise content of the
assertion `P ≠ NP`: the classes differ exactly when some language is decided by a
polynomial-time nondeterministic Turing machine but by no polynomial-time deterministic one.
The theorem is the conjunction of the (proved) inclusion `P ⊆ NP` with pure logic; the
assertion `P ≠ NP` itself is of course open, and is *not* proved here.
