This development is deliberately self-contained (it uses only the Lean 4 core library),
so that the formal statement of the P vs NP problem depends on as little as possible.

We define:
* single-tape deterministic Turing machines and their step-by-step semantics;
* single-tape nondeterministic Turing machines and their reachability semantics;
* the classes `Frontier.P` and `Frontier.NP` of languages decidable in polynomial time by
  deterministic resp. nondeterministic machines;
* polynomial-time computable functions, polynomial-time many-one reducibility `≤p`,
  NP-hardness and NP-completeness;
* the proposition `Frontier.PNeqNP`, i.e. `P ≠ NP`.

The main theorem `Frontier.P_vs_NP_statement` records the precise statement together with
its standard reformulation: `P ≠ NP` holds if and only if some language is decidable in
nondeterministic polynomial time but not in deterministic polynomial time.
