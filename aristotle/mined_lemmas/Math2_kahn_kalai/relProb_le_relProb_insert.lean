# The `p`-biased measure on subsets of a finite set

Auxiliary measure-theoretic development for `RequestProject.Main` (Kahn–Kalai):
the distribution of the random subset `α_p`, its basic properties, and a block
factorisation which expresses independence over disjoint blocks.

/-! ## The Kahn–Kalai setting

We fix a finite ground set `α`.  For `p ∈ [0,1]`, `α_p` denotes the random subset of `α`
containing each point independently with probability `p`; its distribution is given by the
weights `weight p S = p ^ |S| * (1 - p) ^ (n - |S|)`.

A family `H` of subsets is `q`-*small* if it admits a cover `G` — every member of `H`
contains a member of `G` — of total cost `∑_{g ∈ G} q ^ |g| ≤ 1/2`; the *expectation
threshold* `q(F)` is the largest `q` for which `F` is `q`-small, while the *threshold*
`p_c(F)` is the `p` at which `ℙ(α_p ∈ F) = 1/2`.

### Scope of this file

* `Math2.prob_le_half_of_isSmall` proves, for an **arbitrary** family, the easy direction
  `q(F) ≤ p_c(F)`: if `H` is `q`-small then `ℙ(α_q ∈ ⟨H⟩) ≤ 1/2`.
* `Math2.kahn_kalai` combines this with the converse (Park–Pham) direction for families of
  **pairwise disjoint** sets, for which threshold and expectation threshold are within a
  factor `2`, with no logarithmic loss.
* `Math2.bonferroni_le_prob` and `Math2.half_lt_prob_of_not_isSmall_of_smallOverlap` give the
  same converse direction for arbitrary families whose pairwise overlap term is small.
* The full Park–Pham theorem, `p_c(F) = O(q(F) · log ℓ(F))` for an arbitrary `ℓ`-bounded
  family, is **not** formalised here; in that generality only the easy direction is proved.
