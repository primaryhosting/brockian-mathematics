Note on the header: Lean 4 requires `import` commands to be the very first commands in a
file, and `/-! ... -/` is a module doc-comment *command*, not a comment token.  The
required header block is therefore placed immediately after the single `import Mathlib`
line, which is the closest legal position to the top of the file.
