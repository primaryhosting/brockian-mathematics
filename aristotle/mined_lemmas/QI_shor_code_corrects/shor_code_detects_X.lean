/-! ## Setup

Nine qubits, indexed by `Idx = Fin 3 × Fin 3`: the first component is the block
(one of the three "outer" repetition-code slots), the second is the position of the
qubit inside its block.  A computational basis state is a bit string `Idx → Bool`,
and the state space is the corresponding `512`-dimensional complex Hilbert space. -/

/-- Index of a qubit: `(block, position within block)`. -/
abbrev Idx := Fin 3 × Fin 3

/-- Computational basis states of the nine qubits. -/
abbrev BasisIdx := Idx → Bool

/-- The nine-qubit state space. -/
abbrev QState := EuclideanSpace ℂ BasisIdx

/-- The operator acting as the `2 × 2` matrix `M` on qubit `q` and as the identity
on the remaining eight qubits.  Every single-qubit error on qubit `q` is of this form. -/
