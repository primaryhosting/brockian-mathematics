## Overview

We formalise Kirby–Paris hydras and the statement that *every* hydra game terminates, no matter
which head Hercules chops and no matter how fast the hydra grows new heads.

* A hydra is a finite rooted tree, `Hydra.node : List Hydra → Hydra` (the list of subtrees is
  considered up to permutation; all our relations are closed under permutations of children).
* `Hydra.Move n a b` says that `b` is obtained from `a` by one move of the game: Hercules chops
  off a head (a leaf) of `a`, and if the chopped leaf had a grandparent, `n` extra copies of the
  (already modified) parent subtree are grown at that grandparent.
* The main theorem `Frontier.Hydra_Kirby_Paris` states that there is no infinite play (for any
  choice of moves and any growth rates `k i`), and consequently that every strategy kills the
  hydra in finitely many steps.

The proof assigns to each hydra its ordinal `Hydra.ord < ε₀`, in Cantor normal form built with
the *natural* (Hessenberg) sum `♯`, and shows that every move strictly decreases this ordinal.
The key ordinal-arithmetic ingredient, proved here from scratch, is that `ω ^ b` is closed under
natural addition (`KirbyParis.nadd_lt_opow`).
