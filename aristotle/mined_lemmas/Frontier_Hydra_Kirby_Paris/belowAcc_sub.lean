/-- A *hydra* is a finite rooted tree: a node together with the (finite) list of the
hydras hanging from it.  Only the multiset of children matters for the game, but a list
representation is used so that the type is a genuine inductive type. -/

/-- Structural induction principle for hydras: to prove a property of every hydra it
suffices to prove it for `node L` assuming it for every element of `L`. -/
