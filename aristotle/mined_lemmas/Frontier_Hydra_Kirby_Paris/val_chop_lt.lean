Statement: Every hydra game terminates for any strategy (Kirby–Paris).

A hydra is a finite rooted tree.  Hercules repeatedly cuts off a head (a leaf).
If the head is at depth `1` (a child of the root) it simply disappears.  Otherwise
the head is removed from its parent `p` and then an arbitrary finite number `n` of
extra copies of the (already shortened) subtree `p` are attached to the grandparent
of the head.  The Kirby–Paris theorem says that whatever the strategy is — that is,
whichever head is chosen at each turn and however many copies grow back — the hydra
is eventually reduced to the single node `dead = node []`.

The proof below is the usual ordinal assignment: a hydra is mapped to an ordinal
below `ε₀` by `val (node [t₁, …, t_k]) = ω ^ val t₁ ♯ … ♯ ω ^ val t_k`, where `♯`
is the natural (Hessenberg) sum, and each move is shown to strictly decrease this
ordinal.

The key ordinal fact needed — that `ω ^ c` is closed under natural sums — is not in
Mathlib, so it is proved here (`Frontier.nadd_lt_opow_omega0`).
