# Sorting Lb 5

A comparison sort on `5` elements is modelled as a binary comparison decision tree:
each internal node asks a comparison `x i < x j` between two of the five input
positions, and each leaf outputs the permutation describing the sorted order.

The input is encoded by a permutation `σ : Equiv.Perm (Fin 5)` giving the rank
`σ i` of the element in position `i`; the comparison at a node `(i, j)` is
answered by `σ i < σ j`.  Correctness means the tree outputs `σ` on input `σ`.

The main result `CS.sorting_lb_5` says that the depth (worst-case number of
comparisons) of any correct tree is at least `⌈log₂ (5!)⌉ = 7`.
