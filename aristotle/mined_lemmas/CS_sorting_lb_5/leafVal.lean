/-- An input to a comparison sort of 5 elements is a "ranking": a permutation `s` of `Fin 5`
assigning to each position `i` its rank `s i`.  A comparison of positions `i` and `j` returns
`decide (s i < s j)`. -/
abbrev Rank := Equiv.Perm (Fin 5)

/-- A comparison-based decision tree for sorting 5 elements: an internal node compares two
positions and branches on the outcome, a leaf outputs a permutation (the claimed ranking). -/
inductive DTree : Type
  | leaf : Rank → DTree
  | node : Fin 5 → Fin 5 → DTree → DTree → DTree

/-- The worst-case number of comparisons performed by the tree. -/

noncomputable def leafVal (bs : List Bool) : Rank :=
  if h : ∃ s : Rank, ans allPairs s = bs then h.choose else 1

/-- There **is** a comparison-based decision tree that sorts correctly, so the lower bound
above is not vacuous. -/
