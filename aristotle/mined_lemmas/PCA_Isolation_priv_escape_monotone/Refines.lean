# A formal model of an isolation engine

This file develops a small but complete formal model of the "isolation engine" of a
*privilege-controlled architecture* (`PCA`).

An `Engine` is a (possibly infinite) transition system on a type of machine states
together with a distinguished set of *trusted* states (the isolation boundary).
A *privilege escape* from a state `s` is the existence of a run of the engine starting
at `s` and ending outside the isolation boundary.

The main results are:

* `PCA.Isolation.priv_escape_monotone` — escapes are monotone along refinement: making
  the engine more permissive (more transitions, fewer trusted states) can only create
  escapes, never remove them.
* `PCA.Isolation.isolation_sound` / `PCA.Isolation.isolation_complete` — an inductive
  invariant contained in the isolation boundary is a sound *and* complete certificate of
  the absence of privilege escapes.
* `PCA.Isolation.escapeCheck_iff` — for a finite-state engine the explicit reachability
  computation `escapeCheck` decides privilege escape: it is sound and complete with
  respect to the relational semantics.
