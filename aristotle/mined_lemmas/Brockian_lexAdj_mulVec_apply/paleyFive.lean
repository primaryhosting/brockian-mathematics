# Axiom report

Building this module prints the axiom dependencies of every headline result of the
Paley–Pentagon spectral compiler.  All of them depend only on the three standard axioms of
Lean/Mathlib (`propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`): the development contains no
unproved placeholders, no extra axioms, and no kernel-bypassing evaluation.

# The Paley–Pentagon spectral compiler

Let `H` be a regular graph on `q = 2m+1` vertices with adjacency matrix `B`, of degree
`s = (q-1)/2 = m`, whose nonconstant eigenvalues are
`r = (-1+√q)/2` and `τ = (-1-√q)/2`, each of multiplicity `m = (q-1)/2`
(a *conference graph*; the Paley graphs are the standard examples).

Let `X = C₅[H]` be the lexicographic product of the pentagon with `H`, so that
`A_X = A(C₅) ⊗ J_q + I₅ ⊗ B`.  Then `X` is `D`-regular with `D = (5q-1)/2`, and this file
computes the *exact* spectrum of the normalized Laplacian `I - D⁻¹ A_X` of `X`:

| eigenvalue | multiplicity |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | `1` |
| `q(5-√5)/(5q-1)` | `2` |
| `q(5+√5)/(5q-1)` | `2` |
| `(5q-√q)/(5q-1)` | `5(q-1)/2` |
| `(5q+√q)/(5q-1)` | `5(q-1)/2` |

The proof is the "compiler" pattern: the space of functions on `V(X)` splits into
`base ⊗ constants` (where `J_q` acts as `q`, so `A_X` acts as `q·A(C₅) + s`) and
`base ⊗ constant-orthogonal` (where `J_q` acts as `0`, so `A_X` acts as `I₅ ⊗ B`), and the
dimensions of the exhibited eigenspaces already add up to `5q`, which forces them to be the
whole eigenspaces.

/-! ### Future target: the Paley instantiation for general prime powers

Instantiating `PaleySpectrumData` from the quadratic-character description of the Paley
graph of an arbitrary finite field of order `q ≡ 1 mod 4` needs the character-sum
computation of the eigenvalues of the Paley graph, which is not available in Mathlib at
the time of writing.  The statement of that missing input is recorded below as a
*definition of a proposition*.  It is deliberately **not** assumed anywhere: nothing in
this file depends on it, and no axiom is introduced. -/

open scoped Classical in
/-- **Future target** (not proved here, and not assumed anywhere): every finite field of
order `q ≡ 1 mod 4` gives rise to `PaleySpectrumData` whose fibre graph is the Paley graph
of that field, i.e. the graph on the field in which `x ~ y` iff `x - y` is a nonzero
square. -/
