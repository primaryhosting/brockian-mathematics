Provenance: Aristotle theorem prover (Harmonic)

Erasing one bit of information dissipates at least `k T log 2` of heat.

The setting formalised here is the standard statistical-mechanical derivation:

* the memory is a two-state system (`Bool`), initially in the uniform state
  (one bit of information, entropy `log 2`);
* the heat bath is a finite system with energies `E`, initially in the Gibbs
  state at inverse temperature `beta = 1 / (k T)`;
* system and bath are initially uncorrelated;
* the joint system is isolated, so its Shannon entropy does not decrease
  (in particular this holds, with equality, for reversible microscopic
  dynamics, i.e. for a bijection of the joint state space);
* the process is an *erasure*: the final marginal state of the memory is a
  point mass.

Then the heat `Q` absorbed by the bath is at least `k T log 2`.

The proof uses: invariance of Shannon entropy under relabelling, additivity on
product distributions, subadditivity (both consequences of Gibbs' inequality)
and the maximum-entropy property of the Gibbs state.
