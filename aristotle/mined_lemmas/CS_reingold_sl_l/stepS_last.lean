## Scope of this file

Reingold's theorem `SL = L` says that undirected `s`-`t` connectivity can be decided in
logarithmic space.  Its proof has two ingredients:

1. a logarithmic-space transformation turning an arbitrary undirected graph into a
   constant-degree graph of logarithmic diameter (an expander), preserving connectivity, and
2. the observation that connectivity in a constant-degree graph of logarithmic diameter is
   decidable in logarithmic space, by exhaustively trying all label sequences of logarithmic
   length.

What is formalized and proved here, axiom-free, is a complete machine model of space-bounded
computation with oracle access to the input graph, together with step 2: the theorem
`CS.reingold_sl_l` builds an explicit machine with polynomially many configurations (i.e.
`O(log n)` bits of memory) that decides `s`-`t` connectivity on `d`-regular graphs of diameter
at most `C * log₂ n`.  Step 1 — the expander transformation via the zig-zag product — is *not*
formalized here, so the general statement `SL = L` is not obtained.

/-! ## Undirected graphs given by a rotation map -/

/-- A `d`-regular undirected graph on the vertex set `Fin n`, presented (as in Reingold's
algorithm) by a *rotation map*: `nbr v i` is the `i`-th neighbour of `v`, and `rot v i` is the
label under which the edge is traversed backwards.  The axiom `nbr_rot` says that following an
edge and then its reverse label returns to the starting vertex; this is exactly what makes the
adjacency relation symmetric, i.e. the graph undirected. -/
