# Core of the Mermin–Wagner argument

This file contains the model-independent part of the Mermin–Wagner theorem:
a finite collection of classical `O(2)` spins with an arbitrary nonnegative,
rotation-invariant pair interaction, plus arbitrary single-site terms
(boundary conditions / external fields).

The main result `Phys.abs_magnetization_le` bounds the magnetization at a
distinguished site `o` by the *Dirichlet energy* of any "spin wave" profile
`a : V → ℝ` which equals `π` at `o` and vanishes wherever a single-site term
is present.
