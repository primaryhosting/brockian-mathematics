Arithmetical truth is not arithmetically definable (Tarski's undefinability theorem).

Everything is built from scratch: the syntax of first-order arithmetic (with named
variables), its satisfaction relation in the standard model `ℕ`, the notion of an
arithmetically definable set/relation, Gödel numberings, and the truth set.
