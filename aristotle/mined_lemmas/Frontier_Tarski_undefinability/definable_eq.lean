This file is deliberately self-contained (it needs no imports): it develops the
syntax and the standard-model semantics of first-order arithmetic from scratch and
proves Tarski's undefinability theorem for it.

/-! ## Syntax of first-order arithmetic

Variables are indexed by natural numbers.  Terms are built from `0`, the successor
function, addition and multiplication; formulas are built from equations between
terms using negation, conjunction and universal quantification (the remaining
connectives and the existential quantifier are definable from these). -/

/-- Terms of the language of arithmetic. -/
inductive ATerm where
  | var : Nat → ATerm
  | zero : ATerm
  | succ : ATerm → ATerm
  | add : ATerm → ATerm → ATerm
  | mul : ATerm → ATerm → ATerm
  deriving DecidableEq

/-- Formulas of the language of arithmetic. -/
inductive AFormula where
  | eq : ATerm → ATerm → AFormula
  | not : AFormula → AFormula
  | and : AFormula → AFormula → AFormula
  | all : Nat → AFormula → AFormula
