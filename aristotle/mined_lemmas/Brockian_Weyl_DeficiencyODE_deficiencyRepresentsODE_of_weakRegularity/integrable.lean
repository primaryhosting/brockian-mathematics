# Weyl deficiency spaces are represented by solutions of the Schrödinger ODE

For a continuous potential `q : ℝ → ℝ` and a spectral parameter `z : ℂ`, consider the
formally symmetric differential expression `τ u = -u'' + q u` on the line.  The minimal
operator is the restriction of `τ` to test functions, and the deficiency space at `z`
consists of the `L²` functions `u` which satisfy `τ u = z u` *weakly*, i.e. in the sense
of distributions:

  `∫ u φ'' = ∫ (q - z) u φ`   for all real test functions `φ`.

The main result of this file, `deficiencyRepresentsODE_of_weakRegularity`, states that
this deficiency space coincides with the set of `L²` functions which agree almost
everywhere with a *classical* (twice differentiable) solution of the ODE
`-u'' + q u = z u`.

The nontrivial inclusion is a regularity statement — every weak solution is almost
everywhere a classical solution — which is proved here from scratch (`weakRegularity`)
from the du Bois-Reymond lemmas of `Brockian.Weyl.WeakDerivative`; consequently the final

theorem integrable {φ : ℝ → ℝ} (hφ : IsTestFunction φ) : Integrable φ volume :=
