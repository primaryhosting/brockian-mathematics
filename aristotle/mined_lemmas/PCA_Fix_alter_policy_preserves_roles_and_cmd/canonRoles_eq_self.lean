/-! ## The isolation engine model

A *proof-carrying app* is described by a manifest consisting of

* a command line (`cmd`),
* a list of granted roles (`roles`),
* an isolation policy (`policy`).

The isolation engine only ever produces *canonical* manifests: empty command
arguments are dropped and the role list is canonicalised (deduplicated and put
into a fixed order of decreasing privilege).  Re-configuring an app by applying
a list of policy edits re-runs the engine's build pipeline, so a priori it could
also change the command line or the roles.  The target theorem states that on
well-formed (i.e. engine-produced) manifests this never happens: altering the
policy preserves roles and command exactly. -/

/-! ## Main theorem -/

/-- **Altering the policy preserves roles and command.**
Re-running the engine's build pipeline after applying an arbitrary list of
policy edits leaves the roles and the command line of a well-formed manifest
untouched (and, of course, installs the edited policy). -/
