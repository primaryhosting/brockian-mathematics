# Dilworth's theorem

In a finite partial order, the minimum number of chains needed to cover the order equals the
maximum size of an antichain.

The main work is done with the auxiliary notion of a *chain colouring*: a map `f : α → ℕ`
assigning to each element of a finite set `s` a colour `< n` such that any two elements of `s`
with the same colour are comparable (i.e. the colour classes are chains).

The main results are:

* `Brockian.Dilworth.dilworth_cover`: if every antichain has at most `n` elements, then the whole
  (finite) order can be covered by at most `n` chains;
* `Brockian.Dilworth.dilworth`: if moreover `n` is attained by some antichain, the cover can be
  taken to consist of exactly `n` chains;
* `Brockian.Dilworth.card_le_card_of_cover`: the converse inequality, i.e. any antichain is at most
  as large as any covering family of chains.

Together, `dilworth` and `card_le_card_of_cover` say that the maximum size of an antichain equals
the minimum number of chains needed to cover the order.

The statement of `dilworth` differs slightly from the one originally posed, which asked for a
cover by exactly `n` chains assuming only that `n` bounds the size of every antichain; that form
is false, and `Brockian.Dilworth.exact_cover_counterexample` gives an explicit counterexample.

minimum number of chains needed to cover the order. -/
