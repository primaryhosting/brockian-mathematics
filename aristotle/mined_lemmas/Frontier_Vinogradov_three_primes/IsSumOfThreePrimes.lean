Note on file layout: Lean 4 requires `import` commands to be the very first
commands in a file, so the mandated header block appears immediately after the
single `import Mathlib` line.

Contents:
* `Frontier.IsSumOfThreePrimes`, `Frontier.VinogradovThreePrimes`: the formal
  statement "every sufficiently large odd number is a sum of three primes".
* `Frontier.Vinogradov_three_primes`: a Lean-checked reduction of that statement
  to the binary Goldbach conjecture (in its eventual form).
* `Frontier.isSumOfThreePrimes_of_le_10003`: the unconditional base case,
  verified by kernel computation for every odd `n` with `7 ≤ n ≤ 10003`.
* `Frontier.infinite_odd_isSumOfThreePrimes`: unconditionally, infinitely many
  odd numbers are sums of three primes.
