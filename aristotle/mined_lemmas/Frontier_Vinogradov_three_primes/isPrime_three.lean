# Bridge to Mathlib's `Nat.Prime`

`RequestProject.Main` is import-free (so that the required header comment can be the very first
thing in the file, which Lean forbids for files containing `import` commands).  This file checks
that the elementary primality predicate `Frontier.IsPrime` used there is exactly Mathlib's
`Nat.Prime`, and restates the results of `RequestProject.Main` in Mathlib's vocabulary.
