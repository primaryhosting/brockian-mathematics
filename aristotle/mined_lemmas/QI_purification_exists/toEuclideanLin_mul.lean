# Purification Exists

Provenance: Aristotle theorem prover (Harmonic)

Every mixed state has a purification, unique up to a unitary on the ancilla.

A mixed state on an `n`-dimensional Hilbert space `H` is a positive semidefinite matrix `ρ`
of trace one.  A pure state of the composite system `H ⊗ K`, with `K` an `m`-dimensional
ancilla, is encoded by its matrix of coefficients `psi : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin m) ℂ` in the
product basis, and the partial trace over the ancilla is `reducedDensity psi = psi * psiᴴ`.

The uniqueness statement is the operator fact `A Aᴴ = B Bᴴ → ∃ U unitary, B = A U`, which we
derive from `LinearIsometry.extend`: the assignment `Aᴴ x ↦ Bᴴ x` is a well-defined isometry
on `range Aᴴ` and extends to an isometry of the whole space.
