The Hückel (tight-binding) Hamiltonian of the cyclic polyene `C₁₈` is, up to the affine
normalisation `H = α + β A`, the adjacency matrix `A` of the cycle graph `C₁₈`.
We prove that a complex number `μ` is an eigenvalue of that adjacency matrix precisely when
`μ = 2 cos (2πk/18)` for some `k ∈ {0, …, 17}`.

The vertex type of `SimpleGraph.cycleGraph 18` is `Fin 18`, which is `ZMod 18`; all index
arithmetic below is therefore modulo `18`.
