# Vectorization, the modular operator and relative entropy

We vectorize matrices, express the relative entropy `Tr ρ log ρ - Tr ρ log σ` as (minus) a
quadratic form of `log (σ ⊗ (ρ⁻¹)ᵀ)` at the vectorization of `√ρ`, and record the
variational ("completing the square") characterization of resolvent quadratic forms.
