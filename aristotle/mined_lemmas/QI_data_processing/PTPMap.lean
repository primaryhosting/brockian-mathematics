Scope note.

The data-processing inequality states that relative entropy is monotone under
channels.  This file develops the inequality in the *commutative* (equivalently:
jointly diagonalisable / classical) sector of quantum information theory, where a
CPTP map restricted to a commuting family of states is exactly a stochastic map
between the corresponding spectra, and the quantum relative entropy
`Tr ρ (log ρ - log σ)` is exactly the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the two
spectra.

Everything below is proved from scratch: the log-sum inequality (from convexity
of `x ↦ x log x`), the data-processing inequality `QI.data_processing`, and, as a
corollary of it, Gibbs' inequality (nonnegativity of relative entropy).

The last section leaves the commutative sector: it proves the data-processing
inequality `QI.data_processing_max` for the max-relative entropy
`D_max(ρ‖σ) = log inf {λ ≥ 0 | ρ ≤ λ σ}` for arbitrary, possibly noncommuting,
density matrices and arbitrary positive trace-preserving maps (in particular all
CPTP maps).
