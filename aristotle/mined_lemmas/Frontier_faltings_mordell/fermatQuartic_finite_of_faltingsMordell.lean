## Overview

Faltings' theorem (the Mordell conjecture) states that a smooth projective curve of genus
`≥ 2` over `ℚ` has only finitely many rational points.

In this file we

* formalise the statement for smooth plane curves in `ℙ²`, where the genus is given by the
  degree–genus formula `g = (d-1)(d-2)/2`, so that `d ≥ 4` is exactly the condition `g ≥ 2`
  (`Frontier.FaltingsMordellStatement`);
* verify, unconditionally, an instance of it: the Fermat quartic `x⁴ + y⁴ = z⁴`, a smooth
  plane curve of degree `4` and hence of genus `3`, has only finitely many rational points
  (`Frontier.faltings_mordell`) — indeed exactly four (`Frontier.fermatQuartic_projPoints`).
  The proof uses Fermat's Last Theorem for exponent four.
