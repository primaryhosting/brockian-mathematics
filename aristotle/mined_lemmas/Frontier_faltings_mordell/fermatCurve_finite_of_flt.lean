## Faltings' theorem (the Mordell conjecture)

Faltings' theorem states that a smooth projective curve of genus `≥ 2` defined over `ℚ` has
only finitely many rational points.  Mathlib currently has no definition of the genus of a
curve, so we formalize the statement for the classical family of test cases: the *Fermat
curves* `x ^ n + y ^ n = 1`.  The smooth plane projective curve `x ^ n + y ^ n = z ^ n` has
genus `(n - 1) * (n - 2) / 2`, which is `≥ 2` exactly when `n ≥ 4`; so the assertion
`FaltingsForFermatCurves` below is precisely the content of Faltings' theorem for this family.

We prove:

* `Frontier.fermatCurve_finite_of_flt`: a Lean-checked *reduction* of Faltings' theorem for the
  Fermat curve of even degree `n ≥ 1` to Fermat's Last Theorem for the exponent `n`;
* `Frontier.faltings_mordell` (the target): the resulting unconditional *base case* — for every
  `n` divisible by `4` (in particular the genus `3` quartic `x ^ 4 + y ^ 4 = 1`), the Fermat
  curve has only finitely many rational points.  The input is Mathlib's
  `fermatLastTheoremFour`, Fermat's Last Theorem for exponent `4`.
* `Frontier.fermatCurve_eq_of_four_dvd`: in fact the rational points are exactly the four
  trivial ones.
