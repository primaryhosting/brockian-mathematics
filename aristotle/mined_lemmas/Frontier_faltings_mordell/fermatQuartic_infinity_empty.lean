## Overview

Faltings' theorem (the Mordell conjecture) states that a smooth projective curve of genus
at least `2` defined over `ℚ` has only finitely many rational points.

Here we formalize the statement for *smooth plane curves*, where the genus is given by the
degree–genus formula `g = (d-1)(d-2)/2`, so that "genus ≥ 2" is exactly "degree ≥ 4".
The general statement is recorded as `Frontier.MordellConjecturePlane` (a `Prop`-valued
definition, not proved here — it is Faltings' theorem).

We then prove, unconditionally and axiom-cleanly:

* `Frontier.projectivePoints_finite_of_affine`: a Lean-checked reduction of the finiteness of
  the rational points of a projective plane curve to finiteness of its affine rational points
  together with its rational points at infinity;
* `Frontier.mordellPlane_of_affine_finiteness`: the resulting reduction of
  `MordellConjecturePlane` to the affine statement;
* `Frontier.faltings_mordell`: the base case for the Fermat quartic `x⁴ + y⁴ = z⁴`, a smooth
  plane curve of degree `4` (hence of genus `3 ≥ 2`), whose set of rational points in `ℙ²(ℚ)`
  is proved finite — in fact it consists of exactly the four points
  `(±1 : 0 : 1)`, `(0 : ±1 : 1)`.
