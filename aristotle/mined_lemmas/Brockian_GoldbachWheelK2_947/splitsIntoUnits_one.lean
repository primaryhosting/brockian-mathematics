/-- The `K2` Goldbach wheel property at modulus `m`:

every residue class `r` modulo `m` is represented as `p + q` with `p`, `q` prime, where moreover
the two primes may be taken arbitrarily large (larger than any prescribed bound `N`).

This is the "wheel" (residue-class) shadow of the binary Goldbach problem: it says that, modulo
`m`, no congruence obstruction can rule out a representation as a sum of two primes, uniformly in
the size of the primes used. -/
