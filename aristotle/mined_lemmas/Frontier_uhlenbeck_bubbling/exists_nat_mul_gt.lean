## Setting

For a sequence of Yang–Mills connections `A i` on a bundle over a Riemannian manifold `X`
with uniformly bounded energy, the energy densities `|F_{A i}|² dvol` form a sequence of
Borel measures on `X` with uniformly bounded total mass.  Uhlenbeck's theory says:

* (ε-regularity)  there is an energy quantum `ε₀ > 0` such that if the energy in some ball
  around `x` is `< ε₀`, then the convergence is smooth up to gauge near `x` and the
  singularity there is removable;
* (bubbling)  consequently the set of points at which the convergence fails is contained in
  the *concentration set*, which is a finite set with at most `(total energy)/ε₀` points:
  energy concentrates ("bubbles off") at finitely many points only.

The development below formalizes and proves the measure-theoretic core of this picture, in
two forms.

* `Frontier.uhlenbeck_bubbling`: for the limiting energy measure `μ` (of finite total
  energy) and a positive energy quantum `ε₀`, the bubbling set is closed and finite, the
  number of bubble points satisfies `#(bubble points) · ε₀ ≤ total energy`, and — given
  ε-regularity as a hypothesis — every point off the bubbling set is a regular point.
  This is exactly the reduction of Uhlenbeck bubbling to the local ε-regularity theorem.

* `Frontier.uhlenbeck_bubbling_sequence`: the same conclusions directly along a *sequence*
  of energy measures with uniformly bounded total energy `E`, where the bubbling set is
  defined through the lower limit of the energy in small balls; no weak limit of measures
  needs to be extracted.  (The lower limit is the correct notion here: with the upper limit
  the statement is false, since energy may oscillate between two points along a sequence.)

The two remaining analytic inputs of Uhlenbeck's theorem — the local ε-regularity /
removable singularity theorem and Uhlenbeck's gauge fixing — enter as the hypothesis `hreg`.
