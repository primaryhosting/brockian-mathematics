# Uhlenbeck Bubbling

This file formalizes the *bubbling* (energy concentration) part of Uhlenbeck compactness for
Yang–Mills connections, in the measure-theoretic form in which it is used.

A sequence of connections `A n` on a bundle over a Riemannian manifold `X` gives rise to the
sequence of *energy measures* `mu n = |F_{A n}|² dvol`, and a uniform energy bound
`mu n X ≤ E < ∞` is the standing hypothesis of Uhlenbeck's theorem.  The analytic heart of the
theorem (ε-regularity) provides a threshold `eps > 0` below which the connections converge
smoothly, so that failure of compactness is confined to the *bubble set*: those points where
every ball eventually carries at least `eps` of energy.

The results proved here are the quantization/counting half of the statement, which is the part
that is purely about the energy measures:

* `Frontier.uhlenbeck_bubbling` : the bubble set is **finite** and
  `eps * (number of bubbles) ≤ E`;
* `Frontier.uhlenbeck_bubbling_ncard_le` : hence at most `E / eps` bubbles;
* `Frontier.bubbleSet_eq_empty_of_energy_lt` : **base case / removable singularity**, if the
  total energy stays below the ε-regularity threshold, no bubbling occurs at all;
* `Frontier.bubbleSet_const` : for a single limiting energy measure, bubble points are exactly
  the atoms of mass at least `eps` — bubbling is concentration of energy in atoms;
* `Frontier.bubbleSet_const_eq_empty_of_noAtoms` : a non-atomic limiting energy measure has no
  bubbles (removable singularity for the limit);
* `Frontier.uhlenbeck_bubbling_energyDensity` : the same statement phrased directly for
  curvature energy densities `|F_{A n}|²` integrated against the volume measure.

/-- Bubbling stated directly for energy densities: `F n` plays the role of the pointwise
curvature energy `|F_{A n}|²` of a sequence of connections, integrated against the volume
measure `vol`.  If the total energies are bounded by `E < ∞`, only finitely many bubble
points can occur, and their number is at most `E / eps`. -/
