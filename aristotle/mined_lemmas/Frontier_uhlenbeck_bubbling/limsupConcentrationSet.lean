Formalisation of the *bubbling* (energy concentration) part of Uhlenbeck's
compactness theory for Yang–Mills connections.

Setting.  Let `X` be a metric measure space (think of a Riemannian four-manifold
with its volume measure `μ`) and let `A n` be a sequence of connections with
curvature `F_{A n}`.  All that enters the concentration analysis is the sequence
of energy densities `F n x = |F_{A n}(x)|²`, together with the uniform energy
bound `∫ |F_{A n}|² dμ ≤ Λ`.

A point `x` is an *`ε`-bubble point* of the sequence if, no matter how small a
ball we take around `x`, at least `ε` units of energy persistently sit inside
that ball, i.e. `ε ≤ liminf_n ∫_{B(x,r)} |F_{A n}|²`.  (Using `liminf` is the
same as passing to a subsequence along which the local energies converge, which
is how the statement is usually phrased; with `limsup` instead the statement is
*false*, see `Frontier.limsup_concentration_counterexample` below.)

Main result (`Frontier.uhlenbeck_bubbling`): the set of `ε`-bubble points is
finite, and the number of bubbles is controlled by the energy:
`(number of bubbles) * ε ≤ Λ`.  In particular at most `⌊Λ/ε⌋` bubbles can form,
and if the total energy is below the threshold `ε` no bubbling occurs at all.

/-- The `liminf` in the definition of the bubble set cannot be replaced by a `limsup`:
there is a sequence of probability measures on `ℕ` (unit total energy, so `Λ = ε = 1`)
whose `limsup`-concentration set is infinite.  Concretely, `E n` is the Dirac mass at
`(Nat.unpair n).1`, so every point carries a full unit of mass infinitely often. -/
