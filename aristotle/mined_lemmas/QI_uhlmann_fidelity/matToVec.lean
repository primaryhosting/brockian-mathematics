/-! ## Basic notions

We work with a finite dimensional quantum system with Hilbert space `EuclideanSpace ℂ n`.
States are described by positive semidefinite matrices, and a purification of a state `ρ`
on the system is a vector of the composite system `EuclideanSpace ℂ (n × m)` (the tensor
product of the system with an ancilla) whose reduced density matrix (the partial trace over
the ancilla) is `ρ`.

/-- The partial trace over the second (ancilla) tensor factor. -/

/-- The matrix associated to a vector of `EuclideanSpace ℂ (n × m)`. -/
