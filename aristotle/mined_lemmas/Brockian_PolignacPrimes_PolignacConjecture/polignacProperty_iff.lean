## Overview

De Polignac's conjecture states that for every positive even number `n` there are infinitely
many pairs of *consecutive* primes whose difference is `n`.  This is an open problem (it contains
the twin prime conjecture as the case `n = 2`), so what is proved here is a *conditional
reduction*: the full conjecture is derived from a two-form special case of Dickson's conjecture
on prime values of linear forms (`DicksonPairHypothesis`).

The reduction is the classical sieve-free argument: given an even `n ≥ 2`, one uses the Chinese
remainder theorem to build an arithmetic progression `r + M ℕ` such that

* every `p ≡ r [MOD M]` has `p + k` divisible by a fixed prime `< p` for each `0 < k < n`
  (so all the numbers strictly between `p` and `p + n` are composite), and
* the pair of linear forms `r + M m`, `r + n + M m` is admissible, i.e. no prime divides
  the product for all `m`.

Dickson's conjecture applied to this pair then produces infinitely many consecutive prime pairs
with gap exactly `n`.

Unconditional results proved here as well:

* `Brockian.PolignacPrimes.eq_two_of_odd_gap` – for odd `n` at most one prime `p` has `p + n`
  prime, so the evenness hypothesis in the conjecture is necessary;
* `Brockian.PolignacPrimes.not_polignacProperty_of_odd`;
* `Brockian.PolignacPrimes.polignacProperty_iff` – reformulation of the "infinitely many"
  clause as an unboundedness statement.
