# Five Color Theorem

## Overview

`Mathlib` contains no theory of planar graphs (no embeddings, no Euler formula, no
Kuratowski theorem), so this file develops from scratch the combinatorial core of the
classical inductive proof of the Five Colour Theorem.

The classical proof, for a finite planar graph `G`, runs as follows.

* By Euler's formula a planar graph on `n ≥ 3` vertices has at most `3n - 6` edges.
* Hence the sum of the degrees is at most `6n - 12`, so some vertex has degree at most `5`.
* Delete such a vertex `v`, five-colour `G - v` by induction, and extend the colouring.
  If `deg v ≤ 4` the extension is immediate: the neighbours of `v` occupy at most four of
  the five colours.  Only the remaining case `deg v = 5` needs Kempe's chain exchange.

Everything except the Kempe chain exchange is formalised here:

* `Frontier.Degenerate`   — the degeneracy hypothesis extracted from Euler's formula;
* `Frontier.exists_partial_coloring`, `Frontier.colorable_of_degenerate` — the greedy
  colouring argument in full generality: a `k`-degenerate finite graph is
  `(k + 1)`-colourable;
* `Frontier.edgeCountIn`, `Frontier.EulerEdgeBound` — the planarity input, namely the
  Euler edge bound `e(H) ≤ 3·|H| - 6` for all induced subgraphs `H`;
* `Frontier.sum_degIn_eq_two_mul_edgeCountIn` — the handshake lemma for induced subgraphs;
* `Frontier.degenerate_four_of_eulerEdgeBound` — the averaging argument turning the Euler
  bound into `4`-degeneracy for graphs on at most `11` vertices;
* `Frontier.five_color_theorem` — the Five Colour Theorem for planar graphs on at most
  `11` vertices.

The bound `11` is exactly where the greedy argument stops being sufficient: for `n ≥ 12`
the Euler bound only forces a vertex of degree `≤ 5`, which is the case reserved for Kempe
chains.  So the statement proved here is the sharp "base case" of the induction that the
greedy half of the argument can reach.

/-- **Five Colour Theorem** (special/base case).

Every planar graph on at most `11` vertices is `5`-colourable.

Planarity enters only through Euler's edge bound `EulerEdgeBound`: every induced subgraph
on `n ≥ 3` vertices has at most `3n - 6` edges, which is the standard consequence of
Euler's formula `|V| - |E| + |F| = 2` for plane graphs.  For `n ≤ 11` this bound already
forces a vertex of degree at most `4` in every induced subgraph, and the greedy colouring
argument then produces a proper `5`-colouring.

The bound `11` is sharp for this method: from `n = 12` on, Euler's bound only guarantees a
vertex of degree at most `5`, and the classical proof must invoke Kempe's chain exchange
argument, which is not formalised here. -/
