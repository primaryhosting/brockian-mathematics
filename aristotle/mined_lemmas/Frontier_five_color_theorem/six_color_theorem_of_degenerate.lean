## Scope of this file

Mathlib (at the pinned version) contains no theory of planar graphs, so planarity is
developed here from scratch: `Frontier.PlaneDrawing` is a straight-line drawing of a graph
in `ℝ × ℝ` and `Frontier.IsPlanar` says that such a drawing exists (by Fáry's theorem this
is equivalent, for finite simple graphs, to the usual topological notion of planarity).

What is proved here is the *base case* of the five colour theorem — the case that the
classical proof settles by a single greedy step, without any Kempe chain interchange:
every finite planar graph each of whose nonempty induced subgraphs has a vertex of degree
at most `4` is `5`-colourable (`Frontier.five_color_theorem`).  Concrete consequences are
that every planar graph of maximum degree at most `4` is `5`-colourable, and that every
graph on at most five vertices is `5`-colourable.

The purely combinatorial half of the remaining case is also proved here: the Kempe chain
interchange `Frontier.kempe_swap_proper`, which recolours a union of components of a
two-coloured subgraph.  What is *not* developed here is the topological input of the full
theorem — Euler's formula and the Jordan curve argument showing that two Kempe chains
around a vertex of degree `5` cannot both exist in a plane drawing.

/-- A straight-line drawing of a simple graph `G` in the plane `ℝ × ℝ`:
vertices are placed at distinct points, edges are drawn as the straight segments between
their endpoints, no vertex lies in the interior of an edge, and the interiors of two
distinct edges are disjoint.  By Fáry's theorem this is, for finite simple graphs,
equivalent to the usual topological notion of planarity. -/
