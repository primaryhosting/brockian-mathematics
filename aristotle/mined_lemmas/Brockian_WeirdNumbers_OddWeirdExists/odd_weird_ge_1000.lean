## Overview

A natural number `n` is *weird* (`Nat.Weird`) if it is abundant (the sum of its proper
divisors exceeds `n`) but not pseudoperfect (no subset of its proper divisors sums to `n`).

Whether an **odd** weird number exists is a well-known open problem; no odd weird number is
known.  Consequently the file below does not claim an unconditional existence proof.
Instead it provides a Lean-checked *reduction*:

* `Brockian.WeirdNumbers.weird_mul_prime` : if `n` is weird and `p` is a prime exceeding the
  sum of the divisors of `n`, then `n * p` is weird.
* `Brockian.WeirdNumbers.OddWeirdExists` : an odd weird number exists **iff** there are
  arbitrarily large odd weird numbers.  In other words, a single odd weird number would
  immediately yield infinitely many.

Unconditionally we also record:

* `Brockian.WeirdNumbers.even_weird_exists` : `70` is an (even) weird number;
* `Brockian.WeirdNumbers.odd_weird_ge_1000` : every odd weird number is at least `1000`
  (the only odd abundant number below `1000` is `945`, and `945` is pseudoperfect).
