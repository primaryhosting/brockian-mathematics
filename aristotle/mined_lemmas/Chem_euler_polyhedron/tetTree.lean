/-- A combinatorial model of the surface of a convex polyhedron (e.g. a fullerene cage).

The data consist of the vertex set, the face set, the *skeleton* (the 1-skeleton graph of the
polyhedron, a simple graph since a convex polyhedron has no multiple edges), the *dual* graph on
the faces (also simple, since two facets of a convex polytope meet in at most one edge), and the
bijection `dualEdge` between the edges of the skeleton and the edges of the dual, coming from the
fact that every edge of a polyhedron is shared by exactly two faces.

Sphericity (planarity) of the surface is encoded by the classical *tree–cotree* structure: there
is a spanning tree `tree` of the skeleton whose complementary edges are exactly the edges of a
spanning tree `cotree` of the dual graph. Such an interdigitating pair of trees exists precisely
for maps on the sphere, and in particular for every convex polyhedron. -/
