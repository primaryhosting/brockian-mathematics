/-- A combinatorial *polyhedral surface*: a finite set of vertices, a finite set of
(undirected) edges, a finite set of face labels, and, for each label, the set of edges
on the boundary of that face. -/
structure Surface where
  /-- The vertices of the surface. -/
  verts : Finset ℕ
  /-- The edges of the surface. -/
  edges : Finset (Sym2 ℕ)
  /-- The labels of the faces of the surface. -/
  faces : Finset ℕ
  /-- The boundary of each face, given as a set of edges. -/
  bd : ℕ → Finset (Sym2 ℕ)

/-- `IsSphere S` says that the surface `S` is a *spherical* (equivalently, planar) map,
i.e. it is the surface graph of a convex polyhedron, described by the standard
construction of plane graphs:

* one may start from a single vertex drawn on the sphere, whose complement is a single face;
* one may attach a new vertex `v` to an existing vertex `u` by an edge drawn inside a face `f`
  (this creates no new face, and the new edge is added to the boundary of `f`);
* one may join two existing vertices `u`, `v` lying on a common face `f` by a new edge drawn
  inside `f`; this splits `f` into two faces, one of which keeps the label `f` and the other
  gets a fresh label `g`, and the new edge lies on the boundary of both.

Every plane graph (in particular the edge graph of a convex polyhedron, e.g. a fullerene
cage) arises in this way; conversely every surface produced by these moves is a plane graph. -/
