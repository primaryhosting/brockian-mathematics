/-! ## Admissible tuples and the Hardy–Littlewood singular series

A finite set `H` of nonnegative integers is *admissible* if for every prime `p` the
elements of `H` do not cover all residue classes modulo `p`.  Equivalently, every local
factor of the Hardy–Littlewood singular series attached to `H` is positive.

The main result `Brockian.SingularSeriesGaps16021610` determines exactly which `d` in the
range `1602 ≤ d ≤ 1610` occur as the diameter of a (large) admissible tuple: precisely the
even ones, and for each of those we exhibit an explicit admissible tuple with at least
`145` elements whose smallest element is `0` and whose largest element is `d`.
