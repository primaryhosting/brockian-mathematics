/-- A finite set of integers `H` is *admissible* (in the sense of the Hardy–Littlewood
prime `k`-tuples conjecture) if for every prime `p` the elements of `H` do not cover all
residue classes modulo `p`.  Equivalently, the local factor of the singular series
`𝔖(H) = ∏_p (1 - 1/p)^{-|H|} (1 - ν_p(H)/p)` is nonzero at every prime. -/
