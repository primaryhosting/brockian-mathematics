## Setting

A *machine model* consists of a type `Code` of machine descriptions, a type `Out` of
possible outputs, and a semantics `run : Code → Code → Out`, where `run e x` is the
next output that machine `e` produces on input `x`.

Two mild structural assumptions are made, both of which hold in any reasonable
model of computation (and are shown to be satisfiable in `exists_diagonalizable`
below):

* `spite : Out → Out` is a *spiteful* transformation: `spite b ≠ b` for every `b`
  (with two distinct possible outputs one can always disagree with a prediction);
* the model is closed under composing a machine with `spite`: for every machine `e`
  there is a machine that runs `e` and then outputs something different.

A machine `p` is a *self-predictor* if, presented with the description of any
machine `e` (including its own), it outputs, before `e` runs, exactly the output
that `e` produces on that description. Applied to `p` itself this in particular
demands that `p` announce its own next output.

/-- A transformation of outputs that always disagrees with its input. -/

def PredictsSelfApplication {Code Out : Type*} (run : Code → Code → Out) (p : Code) :
    Prop := ∀ e : Code, run p e = run e e

/-- **Abstract diagonal argument.**  In any machine model that is closed under
diagonalization against a spiteful output transformation, no machine correctly
predicts the self-application behaviour of all machines — in particular no machine
can always correctly predict its own next output before producing it. -/
