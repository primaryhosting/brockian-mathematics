/-! ## Systems

A (discrete, finite) system consists of a finite set `ι` of elements, each of which can be
in one of finitely many states `Q`; a global state of the system is a function `ι → Q`.
The dynamics are given by a transition probability matrix (TPM): for every current global
state `s`, a probability distribution `prob s` over next global states. -/

/-! ## Main theorem -/

/-- **Integrated information vanishes for a disconnected system.**

`Φ` is defined as the minimum, over all nontrivial bipartitions `(S, Sᶜ)` of the system, of the
effective information `EI` generated across that bipartition — the Kullback–Leibler divergence
between the system's actual next-state distribution and the product of the next-state
distributions of the two parts, averaged over current states with the uniform prior.

If the system is disconnected, i.e. there is a nontrivial bipartition along which its dynamics
factorize (neither side has any causal influence on the other), then `Φ = 0`. -/
