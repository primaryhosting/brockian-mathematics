variable {V : Type*} [Fintype V] [DecidableEq V]

/-- A finite *system*: a set of elements `V` together with nonnegative directed
interaction strengths `w u v` between them. -/
structure System (V : Type*) [Fintype V] [DecidableEq V] where
  /-- Strength of the (directed) causal influence of `u` on `v`. -/
  w : V → V → ℝ
  /-- Interaction strengths are nonnegative. -/
  w_nonneg : ∀ u v, 0 ≤ w u v

/-- The *effective information* across the bipartition `(A, Aᶜ)` of a system:
the total interaction strength that is severed when the system is cut into the
two parts `A` and `Aᶜ`. -/

theorem phi_nullSystem : phi nullSystem = 0 :=
  iit_phi_partition _ disconnected_nullSystem

/-- Non-vacuity check in the other direction: `Φ` is not always `0`.  For the
connected two-element system every proper bipartition severs total weight `2`. -/
