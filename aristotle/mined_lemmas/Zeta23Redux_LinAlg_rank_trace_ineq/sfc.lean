## Proof outline

Write `E` for the orthogonal projection onto the range of `P` (so `tr E = rank P`), `Π` for the
spectral projection of `Q` onto its positive eigenvalues (so `tr Π = posIndex Q`), `S = 1 - Π`
and `R = S E S`.  Testing the Hermitian matrix `A = P + Q` against the Hermitian matrix
`B = c Π + (c/2) R` via `0 ≤ ‖A - B‖_F²` gives `2 tr (A B) - ‖B‖_F² ≤ ‖A‖_F²`.  Since `Π R = 0`,
`‖B‖_F² = c² tr Π + (c²/4) tr (R²)`, and `tr (R²) ≤ tr E` because
`E S E - (E S E)² = ((1 - E) S E)ᴴ ((1 - E) S E)` is positive semidefinite.  The linear term
splits into a `P`-part, `2 tr (P Π) + tr (P R) ≥ tr P`, which is exactly
`0 ≤ tr ((1 - E S E) P (1 - E S E))`, and a `Q`-part, `2 tr (Q Π) + tr (Q R) ≥ 2 tr Q`, which is
checked eigenvalue by eigenvalue using `0 ≤ R ≤ 1` and `R Π = 0`.
