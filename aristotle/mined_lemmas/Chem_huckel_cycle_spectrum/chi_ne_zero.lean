/-- The Hückel (adjacency) matrix of the cycle graph `C n`, with vertices indexed by `ZMod n`:
vertex `i` is joined to `i + 1` and to `i - 1`.  For `n ≥ 3` this is exactly the adjacency matrix
of the simple cycle graph `C n`; for `n = 1, 2` it is the circulant matrix `S + S⁻¹` (`S` the
cyclic shift), which is the convention under which the Hückel spectrum formula holds. -/
