# Collatz Conjecture
Category: Brockian Conjecture
Target: Brockian.CollatzPartial.CollatzConjecture
Verification: pending
Provenance: Aristotle theorem prover (Harmonic)
-/

/-
This file is deliberately self-contained (no `import` lines), so that the header comment
above can literally be the first thing in the file: Lean requires `import` commands to
precede every other command, including module documentation.  Consequently the few
standard facts about function iteration that are used below are proved from scratch.

The Collatz conjecture is a famous open problem.  What is established here is:

* an unconditional reduction of the conjecture to a *descent* hypothesis
  (`reaches1_of_descends`);
* unconditional proofs of descent for every residue class modulo `32` except
  `7`, `15`, `27` and `31`, which sharpen the reduction so that only those four
  classes remain (`CollatzConjecture`);
* unconditional verification of the conjecture for all powers of two and for all
  positive integers below `1000`.

/-- One step of the Collatz map: `n ↦ n / 2` if `n` is even, `n ↦ 3 * n + 1` if `n` is odd. -/
