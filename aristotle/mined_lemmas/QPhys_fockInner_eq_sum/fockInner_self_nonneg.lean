# A concrete model for the canonical commutation relation

This file shows that the hypotheses of `QPhys.heisenberg_uncertainty` are *consistent* with a
nonzero `ℏ`: we build the (algebraic) Fock space of finitely supported sequences `ℕ →₀ ℂ`
with the Bargmann inner product `⟪eₘ, eₙ⟫ = n! δₘₙ`, the annihilation and creation operators,
and the resulting position and momentum operators `X`, `P`, which are symmetric and satisfy
`X P - P X = i` (i.e. `ℏ = 1`).
