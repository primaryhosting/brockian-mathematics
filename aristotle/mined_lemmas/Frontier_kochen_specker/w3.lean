## Setup

We work in the three–dimensional real Hilbert space `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 3)`.
A *noncontextual hidden–variable assignment* for quantum mechanics in dimension `3`
is a function `f` which assigns to every (nonzero) vector `u` — i.e. to every rank–one
projection `|u⟩⟨u|` — a definite truth value `f u : Bool`, in such a way that for every
orthogonal triple of nonzero vectors (equivalently, for every orthogonal resolution of the
identity into three rank–one projections) *exactly one* of the three values is `true`.
The value assigned to a projection is required to depend only on the projection itself and
not on the orthogonal triple ("context") in which it is measured — this is exactly what
noncontextuality means, and it is built into the statement by letting `f` be a function of
the vector alone.

The Kochen–Specker theorem states that no such `f` exists.
