## Contents

The Kochen–Specker theorem states that in a Hilbert space of dimension at least three there is
no noncontextual hidden-variable assignment: one cannot assign to every ray a value in `{0, 1}`,
independently of the measurement context, in such a way that every orthonormal basis contains
exactly one ray of value `1`.

We formalise the four dimensional case, which is the base case admitting a purely combinatorial
(parity) proof, due to Cabello, Estebaranz and García-Alcaine: there are `18` vectors in
`ℝ⁴` arranged into `9` orthogonal frames so that every vector lies in exactly two frames.
Summing the value `1` over the nine frames counts each vector twice, giving `9 = 2 * k`,
which is impossible.

The main statement is `Frontier.kochen_specker`, with `Frontier.kochen_specker_basis` an
equivalent restatement in terms of `OrthonormalBasis`.
