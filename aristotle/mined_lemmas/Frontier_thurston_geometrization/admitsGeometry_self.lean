## The eight Thurston geometries

We formalize a *model geometry* as a topological space `X` together with a group `G`
acting on `X` by homeomorphisms, transitively.  A closed 3-manifold `M` is *geometric*,
modelled on `(X, G)`, when `M` is homeomorphic to a quotient `X / Γ` for a subgroup
`Γ ≤ G` acting freely and properly discontinuously.

The eight Thurston geometries are realized below by concrete model spaces:

* `E³`      : `ℝ³` acted on by translations;
* `S³`      : the unit sphere in `ℝ⁴` acted on by linear isometries;
* `H³`      : the solvable Lie group `ℝ² ⋊ ℝ` (`t` acting by `e^t` on both factors),
              which carries a left invariant metric of constant curvature `-1`;
* `S² × ℝ`  : the unit sphere in `ℝ³` times `ℝ`;
* `H² × ℝ`  : the group `(ℝ ⋊ ℝ) × ℝ`, the affine group of the line (a model of `H²`)
              times `ℝ`;
* `SL(2,ℝ)~`: the universal cover of `PSL(2,ℝ)`, realized as the group of lifts to `ℝ`
              of the projective action of `SL(2,ℝ)` on directions of `ℝ²`;
* `Nil`     : the Heisenberg group;
* `Sol`     : the solvable group `ℝ² ⋊ ℝ` (`t` acting by `e^t`, `e^{-t}`).

In each case the group of the geometry is taken to be a transitive group of isometries
of the model space (for the Lie group models: the group acting on itself by left
translations); we do not verify maximality of these groups, which is what singles out
the eight geometries among all homogeneous 3-dimensional spaces.
