/-- The Pell equation `x² − 3·y² = 1` has a nontrivial integer solution,
i.e. one with `y ≠ 0` (equivalently, other than `(x, y) = (±1, 0)`):
take `(x, y) = (2, 1)`, since `2² − 3·1² = 1`.

(The file has no `import` line because the required header comment must be the very
first thing in the file, and Lean requires `import` commands to precede all other
commands; the proof only uses core `Int` arithmetic, so no import is needed.) -/
