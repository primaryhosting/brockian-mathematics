# Hückel theory for the cycle C₉

The adjacency matrix of the cycle graph `C₉` is diagonalized by the discrete Fourier
(Vandermonde) matrix built from a primitive 9-th root of unity.  Consequently its
characteristic polynomial factors as `∏ k, (X - 2 cos (2πk/9))`, and its spectrum is
exactly `{2 cos (2πk/9) : k = 0, …, 8}` — the Hückel energy levels of a nine-membered
conjugated ring.
