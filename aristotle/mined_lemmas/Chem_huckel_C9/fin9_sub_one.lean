# Hückel theory for `C₉`

The Hückel matrix of the cycle `C₉` (in units where the Coulomb integral is `0` and the
resonance integral is `1`) is the adjacency matrix of `SimpleGraph.cycleGraph 9`.
This file diagonalizes it by the discrete Fourier transform (a Vandermonde matrix built from
a primitive ninth root of unity) and computes its characteristic polynomial and spectrum:
the eigenvalues are `2 cos (2πk/9)`, `k = 0, …, 8`.
