# Gauss–Bonnet (the `n = 1` case of Chern–Gauss–Bonnet) for the 2-torus

This file contains a *smooth* instance of the Chern–Gauss–Bonnet theorem, complementing the
combinatorial theorem `Math2.chern_gauss_bonnet` in `RequestProject.Main`.

For a closed oriented surface `M` the Chern–Gauss–Bonnet theorem reads
`∫_M K dA = 2π χ(M)`.  We prove this for the closed even-dimensional manifold
`T² = ℝ²/ℤ²` equipped with an *arbitrary* conformal metric `e^{2u}(dx² + dy²)`, where `u` is
any doubly periodic potential with enough regularity.  For such a metric the Gauss curvature
is `K = -e^{-2u} Δu` and the area density is `e^{2u}`, so the total curvature is `-∫∫ Δu`,
which vanishes by periodicity — in agreement with `χ(T²) = 0`.
