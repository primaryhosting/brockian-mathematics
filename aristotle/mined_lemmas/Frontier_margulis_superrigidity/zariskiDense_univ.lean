## Overview

Margulis' superrigidity theorem says that a linear representation of an irreducible lattice `Γ`
in a higher-rank semisimple group `G` is, up to passing to a subgroup of finite index, the
restriction of a continuous representation of the ambient group `G`.

This file

* sets up the general notion of *extending a homomorphism defined on a subgroup to a continuous
  homomorphism of the ambient topological group* (`Frontier.ExtendsTo`, `Frontier.Superrigid`,
  `Frontier.VirtuallySuperrigid`);
* records elementary structural facts about this notion (the base case `Frontier.superrigid_top`,
  behaviour under composition and products, uniqueness of extensions, the reduction to the closure
  of the image, and the vanishing of superrigid homomorphisms into abelian targets);
* states Margulis superrigidity for the concrete higher-rank family `SL(n, ℝ)`, `n ≥ 3`, with a
  genuine (polynomial) definition of Zariski density of the image
  (`Frontier.MargulisSuperrigiditySL`);
* proves, as `Frontier.margulis_superrigidity`, the Lean-checked reduction of that statement to
  the statement in which one is allowed first to replace the lattice by an arbitrary subgroup of
  finite index — the standard normalisation step at the start of the proof.

The deep analytic content of Margulis' theorem (the construction of a measurable equivariant map
to a boundary, and its algebraicity) is *not* proved here: it is isolated in the hypothesis of
`Frontier.margulis_superrigidity`.
