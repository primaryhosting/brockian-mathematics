This file is deliberately import-free (Lean core only), so that the header comment
above is literally the first thing in the file.  All arithmetic therefore takes
place in the rational numbers `Rat` of Lean core.  A companion file
`RequestProject/HiggsMassToyReal.lean` develops the same toy model over the real
numbers with genuine derivatives (`Frontier.higgs_mass_toy_real`).
