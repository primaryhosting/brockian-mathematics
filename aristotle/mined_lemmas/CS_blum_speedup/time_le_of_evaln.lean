## Summary

We work in Mathlib's standard model of computation: programs are
`Nat.Partrec.Code`s, and the running time of a program `c` on an input `n` is
`CS.time c n`, the least step bound `k` for which Mathlib's step-indexed
interpreter `Nat.Partrec.Code.evaln k c n` returns a value.  (This is a Blum
complexity measure: it is defined exactly when `c.eval n` converges, and the
predicate `time c n ≤ k` is decidable.)

The main theorem `CS.blum_speedup` says: for every computable, monotone
"speed-up factor" `T` there is a computable function `f` such that **no**
program for `f` is optimal — given any program `c` computing `f` one can
produce another program `c'` computing the *same* function `f` which, on
infinitely many inputs, is faster than `c` by more than the factor `T`:
`T (time c' n) < time c n`.

The corollary `CS.no_fastest_algorithm` states the headline consequence: the
problem `f` has no fastest algorithm, not even in the "almost everywhere"
sense.

## Relation to Blum's original theorem

Blum's speed-up theorem produces speed-ups that hold for *almost every* input.
The theorem proved here gives speed-ups on an *infinite* set of inputs (an
entire column `{Nat.pair e j | j}`, where `e` is the index of the program being
sped up).  This is weaker than the almost-everywhere form, but it is already
enough for the headline statement "there are problems with no fastest
algorithm": an almost-everywhere optimal program would in particular be at
least as fast as every competitor on all but finitely many inputs, which
`CS.no_fastest_algorithm` refutes.

The construction is a direct diagonalisation.  `diagF T n` simulates the
program coded by `n.unpair.1` on the input `n` for `bnd T n` steps and outputs
something different if that simulation converges.  Hence a program `c`
computing `diagF T` must take more than `bnd T n` steps on every input of its
own column, and on that column `diagF T` is identically `0`.  The competitor
`patch c (encode c)` answers `0` on that column (using an explicitly built
equality test whose running time is polynomially bounded) and defers to `c`
everywhere else.
