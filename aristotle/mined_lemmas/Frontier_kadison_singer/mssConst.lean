/-- Weaver's discrepancy-theoretic form `KS₂` of the Kadison–Singer problem, in dimension `d`,
with smallness parameter `ε` and discrepancy constant `C`.

Given finitely many vectors `v i` in `ℂ^d` which form a Parseval frame
(`∑ i, |⟪v i, x⟫|² = ‖x‖²` for all `x`, i.e. `∑ i, v i v i* = I`) and each of which is small
(`‖v i‖² ≤ ε`), the index set can be split into two halves each of which is a frame with
upper bound `C` (i.e. the operator norm of each of the two partial sums `∑ v i v i*` is at
most `C`).

The Marcus–Spielman–Srivastava theorem states that this holds for every `d` and every `ε > 0`
with `C = (1/√2 + √ε)²`. -/

/-- Greedy balancing: a finite family of nonnegative reals, each at most `ε`, can be split
into two parts whose sums differ by at most `ε`. -/
