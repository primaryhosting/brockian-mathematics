The Kadison–Singer problem asks whether every pure state on a maximal abelian self-adjoint
subalgebra (MASA) of `B(ℓ²)` extends uniquely to a state on `B(ℓ²)`.  It was answered
affirmatively by Marcus, Spielman and Srivastava via the method of interlacing families of
polynomials.

This file formalizes and proves in full the *finite-dimensional* case — the base case of the
Kadison–Singer question: for the diagonal MASA of the matrix algebra `Mₙ(ℂ)`, the pure state
`d ↦ d i` of the diagonal has a unique extension to a state on `Mₙ(ℂ)`, namely `A ↦ A i i`.

Here a *state* is a unital positive ℂ-linear functional (`Frontier.IsState`), and the pure
states of the diagonal algebra `ℂⁿ` are exactly the coordinate evaluations `d ↦ d i`.

The proof is the classical one: positivity of `phi` yields a positive semidefinite Hermitian
sesquilinear form `(X, Y) ↦ phi (Xᴴ * Y)`, and the degenerate case of the Cauchy–Schwarz
inequality forces `phi` to vanish on every matrix unit other than `E i i`.
