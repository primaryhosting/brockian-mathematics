# A formal model of the isolation engine's scope check

This file gives a self-contained formal model of the *isolation engine* used to decide
whether a resource (identified by a hierarchical path) is inside a given isolation
scope, together with a proof that the executable (boolean) encoding of the check is
**sound and complete** with respect to the declarative specification.

## The model

* A resource path is a `List α` of path segments (e.g. `["tenant", "db", "table"]`).
* An isolation `Scope` consists of a list of *allow* prefixes and a list of *deny*
  prefixes.
* Declaratively (`InScope`), a path is in scope when some allow prefix is a prefix of
  the path and no deny prefix is a prefix of the path — i.e. deny always overrides
  allow.
* Operationally (`encodeInScope`), the engine evaluates a boolean expression built from
  `List.isPrefixOf` tests.

The main theorem `PCA.Isolation.in_scope_encoding_sound` states that the boolean
encoding returns `true` exactly on the paths that satisfy the declarative
specification; soundness and completeness are the two directions of this equivalence.

/-- **Non-interference / isolation.** If every prefix allowed by `s` is itself denied by
`t`, then no path can be in both scopes: the two scopes are perfectly isolated. -/
