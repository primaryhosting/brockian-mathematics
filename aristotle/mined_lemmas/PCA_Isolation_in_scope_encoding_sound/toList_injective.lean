# In-scope encoding soundness, Mathlib (`Finset`) formulation

`RequestProject/Main.lean` states and proves the target theorem
`PCA.Isolation.in_scope_encoding_sound` for policies given as lists.  (That file must
begin with the prescribed header docstring, which Lean does not allow to precede an
`import`, so it is written against Lean's core `List`/`String` API only.)

This companion file works in full Mathlib and restates the same soundness /
completeness result for policies given as `Finset`s of paths, deriving it from the
encoding lemmas of `RequestProject.Main`.

proved here by induction on the prefix candidate. -/
