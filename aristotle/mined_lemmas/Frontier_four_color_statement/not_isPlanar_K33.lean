/-- `IsMinor H G` says that `H` is a *minor* of `G`: there is a family of pairwise disjoint
"branch sets" `B w ⊆ V`, one for each vertex `w` of `H`, each inducing a connected subgraph
of `G`, such that adjacent vertices of `H` have branch sets joined by an edge of `G`. -/

theorem not_isPlanar_K33 : ¬ IsPlanar K33 := fun h => h.2 (IsMinor.refl K33)

/-- Base case: any graph with at most four vertices is 4-colourable. -/
