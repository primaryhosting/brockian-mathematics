## Contents

Let `K` be a field with a valuation `v : K → ℝ≥0` whose ring of integers is `O`
(`hv : v.Integers O`), and let `p` be a prime with `v p ≠ 1`.  Mathlib implements Scholze's
tilt `K♭` as `Tilt K v O hv p`, the fraction field of the perfection of `O/p`
(`Mathlib.RingTheory.Perfection`, following [scholze2011perfectoid]).

We prove:

* `Frontier.charP_tilt` : the tilt has characteristic `p`;
* `Frontier.tilt_pow_bijective` : the tilt is perfect, i.e. its Frobenius `x ↦ x ^ p` is
  bijective — so `K♭` is a perfect field of characteristic `p`;
* `Frontier.tilt_ringEquiv_self` : the base case of the tilting correspondence — if `K` is
  already a perfect field of characteristic `p`, then tilting is the identity: `K♭ ≃+* K`;
* `Frontier.scholze_perfectoid_tilt` : the three statements packaged together.

Along the way we prove some results of independent interest:
`Frontier.isFractionRing_integers` (a valued field is the fraction field of its ring of
integers), `Frontier.isFractionRing_of_div_surjective` and
`Frontier.isFractionRing_of_ringEquiv`.
