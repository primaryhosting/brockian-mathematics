# Trace-norm bounds for the cosine of a Hermitian matrix (`CosTraceNorm` family)

For a complex `n × n` matrix `B` the *trace norm* (Schatten 1-norm) is the sum of the singular
values of `B`, i.e. the sum of the square roots of the eigenvalues of the positive semidefinite
matrix `Bᴴ * B`.  This file introduces that notion (`Brockian.traceNorm`), identifies it with
`∑ i, |eigenvalue i|` for Hermitian matrices, and proves a family of bounds for the matrix
`cos A := cfc Real.cos A` obtained from a Hermitian matrix `A` by the continuous functional
calculus.
