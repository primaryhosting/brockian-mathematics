# Dijkstra's algorithm

We formalize Dijkstra's algorithm on a finite directed graph with nonnegative edge weights,
and prove that it computes the shortest-path distances.

Weights take values in `ℝ≥0∞` (the nonnegative extended reals): this encodes both the
nonnegativity of the weights and the absence of an edge (weight `⊤`).

* `CS.walkWeight` : the weight of a walk, given as the list of vertices visited after the source.
* `CS.graphDist w src v` : the shortest-path distance, i.e. the infimum of the weights of
  all walks from `src` to `v`.
* `CS.dijkstra w src` : the output of Dijkstra's algorithm.
* `CS.dijkstra_correct` : `CS.dijkstra w src v = CS.graphDist w src v` for every `v`.

/-- The invariant maintained by Dijkstra's algorithm: the tentative distances are the
distances along walks whose intermediate vertices are settled, and the settled vertices
already carry their true distance. -/
