/-! ## Walks and shortest-path distances

A weighted directed graph on the vertex type `V` is given by a weight function
`w : V → V → ℝ≥0∞`; the value `⊤` means "no edge", and all weights are nonnegative
by construction.  A walk starting at `a` is described by the list `l` of the vertices
it visits after `a`; its endpoint is `l.getLastD a`. -/

/-- The cost of the walk that starts at `a` and then visits the vertices of `l` in order. -/

lemma walkCost_append (w : V → V → ℝ≥0∞) (a t : V) (l : List V) :
    walkCost w a (l ++ [t]) = walkCost w a l + w (l.getLastD a) t := by
  induction l generalizing a with
  | nil => simp [walkCost]
  | cons b l ih =>
      rw [List.cons_append, walkCost, walkCost, ih b, List.getLastD_cons, add_assoc]

/-- The single-edge bound. -/
