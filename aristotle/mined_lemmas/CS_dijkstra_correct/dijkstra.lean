/-! ## Graphs, walks and shortest-path distance

A weighted digraph on the vertex type `V` is given by a weight function
`w : V → V → ℝ≥0∞`.  Weights are nonnegative by construction (this is exactly the
hypothesis Dijkstra's algorithm needs), and the value `⊤` encodes the absence of an edge. -/

/-- `walkCost w a l` is the total weight of the walk that starts at `a` and then visits
the vertices of `l` in order. -/

noncomputable def dijkstra (w : V → V → ℝ≥0∞) (s : V) : V → ℝ≥0∞ :=
  ((dijkstraStep w)^[Fintype.card V] (initState s)).2

/-- The loop invariant: tentative distances are upper bounds for the true distances,
they are exact on visited vertices, and on an unvisited vertex `v` the tentative distance
is the length of the best walk to `v` all of whose intermediate vertices are visited. -/
