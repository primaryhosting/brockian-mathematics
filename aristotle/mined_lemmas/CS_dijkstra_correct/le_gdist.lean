/-! ## Walks, their costs, and shortest-path distances

A weighted directed graph on the vertex type `V` is given by a weight function
`w : V → V → ℝ≥0∞`.  Values in `ℝ≥0∞` are automatically nonnegative (this is the
"nonnegative weights" hypothesis), and `w u v = ⊤` encodes the absence of an edge
from `u` to `v`.

A walk starting at `s` is described by the list `l` of the vertices it visits after `s`. -/

/-- The endpoint of the walk that starts at `s` and visits the vertices of `l` in order. -/
