We formalize Dijkstra's algorithm on a finite directed graph whose edge weights are
elements of `ℝ≥0∞` (`ENNReal`).  Using `ℝ≥0∞` encodes exactly the two features of the
setting Dijkstra's algorithm requires: weights are **nonnegative**, and a weight of `⊤`
models a missing edge (so unreachable vertices get distance `⊤`).

`CS.gdist w s v` is the true shortest-path distance: the infimum of the costs of all
walks from `s` to `v`.  `CS.dijkstra w s` is the output of the algorithm (the classical
loop: repeatedly select an unvisited vertex of minimal tentative distance, mark it
visited, and relax all of its outgoing edges).  The main theorem `CS.dijkstra_correct`
states that these agree.
