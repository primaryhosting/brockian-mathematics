# Singular Series Convergence Rate
Category: Brockian Corpus
Target: Brockian.SingularSeriesConvergenceRate
Verification: pending
Provenance: Aristotle theorem prover (Harmonic)

The singular series considered here is the Hardy–Littlewood twin-prime singular series
(without the leading factor `2`),
`𝔖 = ∏_{p odd prime} (1 - 1/(p-1)^2)`,
realised as the limit of its truncations `𝔖(N) = ∏_{p < N, p odd prime} (1 - 1/(p-1)^2)`.

The main result `Brockian.SingularSeriesConvergenceRate` is an *effective* convergence rate:
for every `N ≥ 3`,
`|𝔖(N) - 𝔖| ≤ 1/(N-2)`.
