/-! ## Binary code trees

A binary code tree is a full binary tree whose leaves carry weights (e.g. symbol
probabilities).  Such a tree is exactly the same thing as a binary prefix code on the
leaf symbols: the codeword of a leaf is the sequence of left/right turns leading to it,
so the length of the codeword of a leaf equals the depth of that leaf.
Consequently the *expected codeword length* of the code is
`∑ (weight of leaf) * (depth of leaf)`, which is the quantity `cost` below. -/
