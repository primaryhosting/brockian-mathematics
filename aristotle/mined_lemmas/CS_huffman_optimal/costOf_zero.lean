# Achievability of the Huffman cost

Companion to `RequestProject.Huffman`.  Here we show that the Huffman cost is *attained*:
there really is a prefix code whose expected codeword length equals `CS.huffCost`.

Combined with the optimality bound `CS.huffman_optimal`, this gives
`CS.huffman_isLeast`: the Huffman cost is the least expected codeword length among all
prefix codes.
