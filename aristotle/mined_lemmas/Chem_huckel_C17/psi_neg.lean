`import` lines to precede all commands, so the single `import Mathlib` line comes first.)

We compute the spectrum of the adjacency matrix of the cycle graph `C₁₇`
(the Hückel matrix of a 17-membered annulene, in units where α = 0 and β = 1):
the eigenvalues are exactly `2 cos (2πk/17)` for `k = 0, …, 16`.

The vertex set `Fin 17` is identified with the ring `ZMod 17`, and the proof uses the
standard additive character `ψ a = exp (2πi a / 17)` and discrete Fourier analysis.
