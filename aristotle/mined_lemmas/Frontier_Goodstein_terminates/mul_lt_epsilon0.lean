/-! ## Hereditary base representations

For a base `b ≥ 2`, every positive natural number `n` can be written as
`n = b ^ e * c + r` with `e = Nat.log b n`, `1 ≤ c < b` and `r < b ^ e`, and iterating this
inside the exponent yields the *hereditary base-`b` representation* of `n`.

Two operations are defined by this recursion:

* `ordOf b n` : the ordinal obtained by replacing the base `b` by `ω` in the hereditary
  base-`b` representation of `n` (a "Goodstein ordinal", an ordinal `< ε₀`);
* `shiftBase b n` : the natural number obtained by replacing the base `b` by `b + 1`
  in the hereditary base-`b` representation of `n`.
