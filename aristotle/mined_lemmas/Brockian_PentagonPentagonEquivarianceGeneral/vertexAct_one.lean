# Equivariance of the regular `n`-gon representation of the dihedral group

This file generalises the pentagon (`n = 5`, dihedral group `D₅`) picture to an arbitrary
regular `n`-gon.

The combinatorial model of the vertices of the `n`-gon is `ZMod n`, on which the dihedral group
`DihedralGroup n` acts by `r i • k = k + i` (rotation) and `sr i • k = -i - k` (reflection).

The geometric model is the set of `n`-th roots of unity in `ℂ`, on which `DihedralGroup n` acts by
`r i • z = ζ^i * z` and `sr i • z = ζ^(-i) * conj z`, where `ζ = exp (2πI / n)`.

The main result, `Brockian.PentagonPentagonEquivarianceGeneral`, says that the vertex map
`k ↦ exp (2πI k / n)` intertwines the two actions, for every `n > 0`.  The pentagon case is
recorded as `Brockian.pentagon_equivariance`.
