The quintic `Φ a b = X ^ 5 - a * X + b` over `ℚ`, for suitable natural numbers `a, b`,
is irreducible with exactly three real roots, hence its Galois group is the full
symmetric group `S₅`, which is not solvable.  Combined with the (already formalized)
direction of Abel–Ruffini stating that an irreducible polynomial with a root solvable
by radicals has solvable Galois group, this shows that the quintic `X ^ 5 - 4 * X + 2`
is not solvable by radicals.

The main external ingredients are
* `solvableByRad.isSolvable'` : an irreducible polynomial with a root that is solvable
  by radicals has solvable Galois group;
* `Polynomial.Gal.galActionHom_bijective_of_prime_degree'` : an irreducible polynomial of
  prime degree with at most three non-real roots has full symmetric Galois group;
* `Equiv.Perm.not_solvable` : the symmetric group on five letters is not solvable.

The development of the auxiliary polynomial `Phi` follows the classical argument and is adapted
from the mathlib archive file `Archive/Wiedijk100Theorems/AbelRuffini.lean` (Apache 2.0,
Thomas Browning), which is not part of the `Mathlib` library itself.

/-- **Abel–Ruffini theorem in degree 5** (Galois-theoretic form).

There is an irreducible quintic over `ℚ` — for instance `X ^ 5 - 4 * X + 2` — whose Galois
group is not solvable, and none of whose complex roots is expressible by radicals over `ℚ`.
In particular there is no general solution in radicals for polynomial equations of degree 5. -/
