# Purification of mixed states

A *mixed state* on a finite-dimensional system with index type `n` is a positive semidefinite
matrix `rho : Matrix n n ℂ` of trace `1`.  A *purification* of `rho` with ancilla index type `m`
is a vector `v : n × m → ℂ` in the tensor product whose density matrix `|v⟩⟨v|` has partial
trace over the ancilla equal to `rho`.

The main result `QI.purification_exists` states that every mixed state admits a purification
(with ancilla of the same dimension), and that any two purifications with the same ancilla
differ by a unitary acting on the ancilla alone.
