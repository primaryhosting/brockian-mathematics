# Purification of mixed states

A mixed state on a finite dimensional system `n` is a positive semidefinite matrix `rho` of
trace one.  A *purification* of `rho` is a unit vector `psi` on the composite system
`n × m` (system ⊗ ancilla) whose reduced density matrix (partial trace over the ancilla `m`)
is `rho`.

The main theorem `QI.purification_exists` states that

* every mixed state admits a purification (with ancilla a copy of the system), and
* any two purifications of the same mixed state are related by an isometry acting on the
  ancilla alone (in particular, for ancillas of the same dimension, by a unitary).
